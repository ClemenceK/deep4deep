To jump-start their innovation  engines, corporate entities are forging relationships with startups.  Both sides have a lot to gain from such collaborations: Corporates  gain access to innovative ideas, new forms of revenue generation, and  more flexible ways of working. Startups enjoy expanded sales oppor- tunities and a reputation boost from partnering with established  industry players.  Corporates use five types of innovation vehicles when collaborating  with startups: innovation or digital labs, accelerators, corporate ven- ture capital, partnership units, and incubators. Most use at least one  of these vehicle types, and a few use all five. Both the exact number  and the specific types of vehicles that a given corporate uses depend  on an array of factors, including the company’s size and its industry.  In particular, the level of disruption that prevails in an industry’s   operating environment is a major factor in the industry’s level of inno- vation vehicle use.  Whatever the collaboration’s form, corporate-startup relationships   often start out very positively, with a heady honeymoon period during  which both sides enjoy some early successes. But over time, frustra- tion can set in as one or both partners wake up to the reality that they  are not achieving all of their hopes and expectations. According to  BCG research involving more than 500 companies in Germany, Austria,  and Switzerland, 45% of corporates and 55% of startups are either  “very dissatisfied” or “somewhat dissatisfied” with their corporate-  startup collaborations.   Not surprisingly, every collaboration presents its own unique chal- lenges and opportunities. Nevertheless, we have identified three ap- proaches that can help both sides in any collaboration get more out of  the relationship:   Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 3    • Have a clear, shared rationale for the collaboration.    • Adopt an investor mindset.    • Create links to the core business.   Although our survey focused on Germany, Austria, and Switzerland,  we have observed similar relationship patterns around the globe in  our work with clients.   Going forward, we have every reason to believe that the trends en- couraging collaborations will continue. In our research, 86% of start- ups said that they expect the number of partnerships to increase in  the next three years, and 55% of corporates agree. The reasons sup- porting these expectations include corporates’ need for more radical  innovation, startups’ need for scale, a long-term trend toward shrink- ing barriers to entry, and ever-accelerating rates of change in the mar- ket. Further, as both sides become more experienced with collabora- tion and as competitors become more willing to put aside their  rivalries and cooperate, the circumstantial conditions for collabora- tion will improve.  Today, with their long history of reinvention, European companies  have learned valuable lessons about what makes corporate-startup  collaborations succeed or fail, and best practices have emerged that  provide guidance to both sides on how to make such collaborations  more successful. There is still homework to do. But companies that  succeed will be strongly positioned to withstand competitive pres- sures and market disruptions.  4 | After the Honeymoon Ends   TRENDS IN CORPORATE- STARTUP COLLABORATION  Accelerating market forces are   pressuring even well-established com- panies to innovate and tap new markets in  order to stay ahead of the competition. While  many corporates have been content to pur-  sue internal, incremental change in response  to global competition and disruptive tech- nologies, others have boosted their innova- tion engines by collaborating with startups.  These relationships give corporates access to  startups’ creativity, new ways of working, and  proficiency with new technologies. In return,  startups gain access to corporates’ markets,  customers, and industry expertise—and the  reputational boost of working with major  industry players.   45% of corporates and 55%  of startups are dissatisfied  with their partnerships.  Such relationships often start out very posi- tively, with a heady honeymoon period  during which both sides enjoy some early  successes. Over time, however, frustration can  set in as one or both partners wake up to the  reality that they are not achieving all of their  hopes and expectations. According to BCG   research conducted in Europe, 45% of corpo- rates and 55% of startups are “very dissatis-  fied” or “somewhat dissatisfied” with their  partnerships.   To gather data for this report, we surveyed  187 corporates and 86 startups and conduct- ed a bottom-up analysis of 570 companies in  Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. We also  interviewed more than 30 leaders in the start- up ecosystem, including venture capital and  private equity investors, startup founders,  and executives at public and privately owned  companies. They described a complex collab- oration landscape in which a company can  choose from among various types of innova- tion vehicles, depending on the company’s  size, goals, and expertise. We also identified a  number of steps that companies can take to  improve their likelihood of achieving long- term success, despite the unique challenges  involved in these collaborations. Given the  pace of innovation and the huge potential  benefits at stake, it is critical for both sides to  redouble their efforts to make these relation- ships work after the initial infatuation has  faded.  Increasingly, Corporates and  Startups Are Linking Up To identify promising startups and establish  regular working relationships with them as  part of an innovation strategy, many corpo- rates have set up one or more types of innova- tion vehicles—such as corporate venture capi-  Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 5   tal (CVC) or partnership units. The trend has  gathered significant momentum over the past  decade. In our survey, 65% of corporations re- ported having had some interaction with start- ups during the past three years. Oliver Holle,  CEO of Speedinvest, has noticed a concerted  effort by corporates in recent years to link up  with startups: “The number of corporate in- vestors in startups has increased massively.   Almost all of our fintech portfolio companies  have a corporate investor on board—50% of  all startups we are invested in.”  Highly successful corporates  focus on continuously refining  their innovation vehicles.  Companies in our sample of 570 corporates  use five types of innovation vehicles in their  collaboration efforts: innovation or digital  labs, accelerators, corporate venture capital  (CVC), partnership units, and incubators. (See  the sidebar “Different Innovation Tools Suit  Different Objectives.”) Some types of inno- vation vehicles are clearly more common  than others, however. We found that, at the  end of 2018, 19% of corporates were using at  least one innovation lab or digital lab, 17%  were using one or more accelerators, 17%  were using one or more CVC units, 13% were  using one or more partnership units, and 6%  were using one or more incubators. (See  Exhibit 1.)  The most successful corporates don’t just  build new innovation vehicles; they also con- tinuously refine the ones they already have.  One example of this approach involves the  decision by the German insurance company  Allianz to transform its incubator, Allianz X,  into a CVC unit focusing on strategically rele- vant digital investments. Another example   involves Axel Springer, which operated a joint  accelerator with Plug and Play that provided  accelerator services to more than a hundred  startups. Axel Springer Plug and Play eventu- ally decided to stop taking in new startups;  but it continues to manage its existing port- folio, thereby freeing up resources for acceler- ation in a new collaboration, APX, between   Axel Springer Digital Ventures and Porsche  Digital. Founded in 2018, APX is an accelera- tor for cross-industry startups.   Corporate Size Matters in  Innovation Vehicle Decisions A wide range of companies deploy innovation  vehicles, from large public companies such as  Daimler, UNIQA Insurance Group, and Swiss- com to family-owned businesses such as  Viessmann and Hubert Burda Media to com- panies owned or backed by private equity  such as Sivantos and Otto Bock Healthcare.  Many companies use several different types  of innovation vehicles. (See Exhibit 2.)  The number of vehicles that companies use  varies widely depending on company size  and industry sector. Not surprisingly, large  public companies are more likely than others  to deploy innovation vehicles. There are three  reasons for this. First, large players have more  resources and can afford to place multiple  bets. Second, because big companies tend to  have entrenched ways of conducting business,  they may feel a greater need to explore out- side sources for disruptive thinking. Third, in- vestors often pressure large public corporates  to demonstrate their willingness and ability  to respond to emerging threats.  Of the 30 DAX companies in Germany’s blue- chip DAX index, only one uses no innovation  vehicles at all. In contrast, a substantial 20%  of DAX companies—including, for example,  Daimler—use all five types of innovation  vehicles. Daimler’s combined CVC and M&A  unit, M&A Tech Invest, has made several  acquisitions, including the taxi-ordering app  Mytaxi. (For more on Daimler’s innovation  initiatives, see our 2018 report “How the Best  Corporate Venturers Keep Getting Better.”)  On average, DAX companies use approxi- mately three types of innovation vehicles.  BASF, a leading global chemical company,  maintains multiple vehicles, including its  Chemovator incubator and a CVC unit, BASF  Venture Capital GmbH. “In our fast-moving  world, partnerships with young and dynamic  companies are essential for the transforma- tion of DAX companies,” says Markus Soli- bieda, managing director of BASF Venture  Capital GmbH.   6 | After the Honeymoon Ends   DIFFERENT INNOVATION TOOLS SUIT DIFFERENT  OBJECTIVES  To be most effective, corporate venturing  needs to occur as part of a broader ap- proach to corporate innovation that  clarifies how innovation tools complement  the traditional R&D and M&A functions.  (See the exhibit.) Each tool is geared  toward certain types of innovation (such as  process, product, service, or business  model innovation) and designed to achieve  different effects (specifically, a disruptive  effect or an incremental one). As a result,   it can accelerate innovation faster than  traditional corporate R&D can.   The corporate innovation approach should  also clarify how to use each vehicle to  attain the company’s innovation goals. For  example, if a company wants to learn  about disruptive or new opportunities, CVC  is a good tool. But if it wants to tap quickly  into a new revenue source, M&A will be  necessary to acquire a controlling stake in  a business. A company must also identify  when a particular combination of tools will  best address specific innovation challenges  and how to orchestrate those tools.

Note: Data is from Q4 2018. 1Five unique innovation vehicle types were tracked: innovation lab or digital lab, corporate venture capital, incubator, accelerator, and partnership  unit.  8 | After the Honeymoon Ends   Companies in Switzerland are smaller, on  aver age, than those in Germany, and they use  only about two innovation vehicles per com- pany. Among the companies listed on the  Swiss Market Index (SMI), 90% use at least  one type of innovation vehicle, and 5% de- ploy all five types.   Among the 154 private, family-owned compa- nies we surveyed, 54% reported using at least  one innovation vehicle. On average, compa- nies in this category use one type of innova- tion vehicle per company. Viessmann is  among the few such companies that deploy  all five types of innovation vehicles. Viess- mann’s WATTx incubator specializes in deep- tech companies, and its CVC group consists of  two units: Vito One, which focuses on seed  capital; and Vito Ventures, which focuses on  late-stage funding. The company also has a  digital lab (Maschinenraum [“Engine Room”])  and a partnership unit (Innovation Boiler)  that directs most of its attention to the Inter- net of Things, blockchain, and smart climate  space technologies.  The average company listed on the Austrian  Traded Index (ATX) uses even fewer types of  innovation vehicles than family-owned  companies do. Only 45% of the ATX-listed  companies use at least one type of innovation  vehicle, and none of them use all five. Even   so, some ATX companies are pursuing dif- ferent options in this area. UNIQA Ventures  (the combined CVE and M&A unit of UNIQA  Insurance Group), for example, has multiple  startups in its portfolio in health, mobility,  smart home, and fintech domains. The com- pany also has an incubator, an accelerator  (with about 100 startups on site), and a  digital lab.  We also analyzed 132 private-equity-backed  companies, only about one in ten of which  have as yet adopted any type of innovation  vehicle. Private equity firms do support inno- vation and disruption, but they have tradition- ally tended to do so organically or through  acqui sition, says Olof Hernell, CDO of the   private equity house EQT Partners AB. “Dis- ruption through innovation vehicles is an   untapped opportunity for many companies— if they can afford it,” adds Hernell.   Industries Pressured by  Disruptions Are Leading Adoption Different industries show huge variations in  how extensively the companies in the catego- ry use innovation vehicles. Companies in the  media and publishing, automotive and mobil- ity, and financial institutions and insurance  industries are among the most likely to strike  up partnerships with startups. (See Exhibit 3.)

Note: Data is from Q4 2018. N = 570 (five corporates were not included in this assessment). 1Five unique innovation vehicle types were tracked: innovation lab or digital lab, corporate venture capital, incubator, accelerator, and partnership  unit.  Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 9   Media companies’ legacy business has steadi- ly declined for the past two decades because  of digitization. In response to this threat,  many have sought to transform their business  model. About 70% of surveyed media and  publishing companies use at least one type of  innovation vehicle, and 60% have at least  three types in place. Successful players in this  industry are now on track to digitize their of- fering. Axel Springer, for example, increased  the percentage of its revenue that comes  through digital channels from practically 0%  in 2000 to more than 70% in 2018. It is now  the largest digital publishing house in Europe.  In the automotive and mobility industry,   50% of companies use at least one type of  innovation vehicle, 5% use four types, and 8%  use all five types. The push for innovation in  this industry is due, in part, to momentum  toward electric vehicles and autonomous  driving. New entrants such as Tesla and  established tech players such as Alphabet are  forcing incumbents to jump-start their  programs by tapping startup expertise. The  sharing economy and the declining need that  people who live in European cities feel to  own personal cars are intensifying the  pressure on companies in this industry to  innovate products and business models.   Among financial institutions (FI) and insur- ance companies, 56% use at least one type of  innovation vehicle, but only 11% deploy as  many as four types. As Dr. Andreas Brand- stetter, CEO of UNIQA Insurance Group says,  “FI and insurance are not well known for  their innovative approaches.” The industry’s  competitive landscape is changing, however,  as fintech startups roll out customer-centric  offerings. The Germany-based digital banking  startup N26, for example, became a unicorn  in 2019 and today is valued at $2.7 billion.  Such success stories exert intense pressure on  FIs and insurance companies to invest aggres- sively in innovation vehicles. Allianz X recent- ly increased its fund size to around €1 billion,  making it one of the largest startup invest- ment vehicles in Europe.  An Innovation Vehicle’s Purpose  Determines Its Location There is also some correlation between the  type of innovation vehicle and its location.  (See Exhibit 4.) Innovation vehicles that focus  on transforming the core business—as many  digital labs and partnership units do—are  usually geographically close to corporate  headquarters because they require easy ac- cess to corporate assets and business units.   Exhibit 4 | An Innovation Vehicle’s Purpose Dictates Its Location  Top eight cities for innovation vehicles in  Germany, Austria, and Switzerland   (share of total vehicles)  Hamburg  4%  Essen 3%   Frankfurt 3%   Berlin 20%   Stuttgart 4%  Munich 13%  Vienna  7%  Zurich 8%  Key ﬁndings about each innovation vehicle  Innovation lab or digital lab  • Close proximity to HQ to more easily impact the core business • 25% of digital labs centralized in Berlin, with the rest decentralized in   smaller cities  Accelerator  • Concentrated in startup hubs to access ecosystem • 74% of accelerators in six cities: Munich, Berlin, Stuttgart, Vienna,   Zurich, and Hamburg  Corporate venture capital unit  • Centralized in startup hubs to access ecosystem, but decentralized if   access to facilities or assets is required (as in pharma)  • 53% of CVC units centralized in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and Zurich,   with the remainder decentralized  Partnership unit  • Close proximity to HQ to impact the core business more easily • Decentralized, with twelve cities (including Munich, Berlin, Zurich, and   Stuttgart) holding 72% of partnership units  Incubator  • Centralized in startup hubs to access ecosystem • Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Vienna hold 48% of incubators  Source: BCG analysis. Note: The analysis considered a total of 298 innovation vehicles in 75 cities; concentrations are shown by postal code.  10 | After the Honeymoon Ends   In contrast, other innovation vehicles have   a greater need for access to the startup  ecosystem—talent, business angels, investors,  exchanges with other startups—than for  proximity to the corporate headquarters, so  they tend to be con centrated in startup hubs  such as Berlin, Munich, Zurich, and Vienna.  Accelerators and incubators fall into this  category. As for CVC units, these may or may  not be located near headquarters, depending  on how much access to corporate assets the  startups require and whether the CVC is  focusing entirely on a financial objective.  Coordinated Objectives Help  Some Partnerships to Flourish  Over the past ten years, corporates have ben- efited from startup collaborations in myriad  ways, such as by adopting agile ways of work- ing, applying different tools (such as Slack  and Zoom) in support of new ways of work- ing, encouraging greater collaboration, em- bracing an entrepreneurial mindset that is  less averse to risk and accepts that some fail- ure is necessary in pursuit of innovation, and  adopting innovative product features to ac- quire customers. With regard to agile work- ing, for example, Sivantos and audibene orga- nized 12-month rotations of employees to  strengthen cooperation.   Startup collaborations have  helped corporates adopt new  tools and agile work methods.  Of course, these relationships must meet the  needs of both partners. “Startups and corpo- rates do often have different objectives; this  is what both parties need to understand and  internalize,” says Dr. Ulrich Schmitz, CTO of  Axel Springer. Startups enter into these rela- tionships to increase their sales opportunities  and market access to a large customer base  and to leverage the relationship to bolster  their reputation in the market. “We have  drive, dynamism, flexibility. They have mass,  capital, range. If we want to go out and scale  our impact, we have to go to corporates,” says  Goran Maric, CEO of Three Coins, a social   startup that develops educational products to  increase its users’ financial competency.  One success story—from both partners’   perspectives—involves Axel Springer’s deci- sion to take a controlling stake in StepStone,  a digital job market and talent recruitment  company. While StepStone was striving to   increase its sales and market share, Axel  Springer was building up its digital capabili- ties. After taking control of StepStone in 2009,  Axel Springer pursued an acquisition strategy  to grow and scale the business. It purchased  Totaljobs Group in 2012, followed by Your- CareerGroup and Saongroup in 2013, Jobsite  in 2014, and ICTjob and CareerJunction in  2015. From 2009 to 2016, the company’s reve- nue grew from about $100 million to $362  million, a compound annual growth rate of  roughly 20%. Besides satisfying StepStone’s  market share targets, Axel Springer’s buy- and-build strategy strengthened its own digi- tal capabilities and facilitated its broader digi- tal transformation. In conjunction with an  accelerator and a partnership with Samsung  Electronics, Axel Springer successfully steered  its business toward digitization.   Most Collaborations Don’t Meet  Expectations Ironically, success stories like the one involv- ing Axel Springer and StepStone may have  encouraged many corporate-startup collabo- rations to delay a necessary reckoning. Many  participants in such collaborations realize  that their relationship is not yielding the re- turns they expected and is not delivering on  its full potential. In our survey, 45% of corpo- rates and 55% of startups rated themselves as  either “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dis- satisfied” with the relationship. In contrast,  only 8% of corporates and 13% of startups rat- ed themselves as “very satisfied.” Lea-Sophie  Cramer, founder and CEO of Amorelie, puts it  this way: “Only 5% of collaborations work  well; 95% either do not work at all or are just  mediocre. The reason lies in the huge differ- ence between startups and corporates in  terms of ideas, expectations, and people.”  Less than 50% of corporates reported that the  top three expectations that corporates have  for their partnerships—piloting, more reve-  Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 11   nue or new business, and a cultural shift— have either been “somewhat fulfilled” or  “more than fulfilled.” (See Exhibit 5.) Corpo- rate expectations that have yielded the high- est percentages of fulfillment are technology  and market scouting (58%), digital transfor- mation (55%), and access to products, IP, tech- nology, and data (52%).   Startups are eager to gain   access to their partners’ sales  opportunities and market.  Although 46% of corporates said that collab- orating with startups had a “considerable   impact” or a “major impact” on their core  business, the remaining 54% described the   experience as having had a “slight impact,”   a “limited impact,” or “no impact”—leaving  ample room for improvement in these rela- tionships. The reported level of impact held  steady across all five areas that we measured:   steering and governing, people and commu- nication, entrepreneurial mindset, ways of  working, and financial return.  Overall, startups are even less satisfied than  corporates with the outcomes of their collab- orations: 55% of them described themselves  as either “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very  dissatisfied.” Broadly speaking, startups en- gage with corporates to leverage the “unfair  advantage” that a strong corporate partner  can supply. Startups want to gain access to  their partner’s sales opportunities and mar- ket, and they want its reputation to rub off  on them. Unfortunately, in many cases, these  broad expectations go unfulfilled. Less than  50% of startups said that their expectations  were “somewhat fulfilled” or “more than ful- filled” in terms of sales opportunities (42%)  and market access (44%). More encouragingly,  59% said that their desire for reputation or  reference was satisfied at these levels. (See  Exhibit 6.)   Although those results are far from stellar,  other frequently identified expectations are   Exhibit 5 | Innovation Vehicles Are Only Partly Fulfilling Corporates’ Expectations  Corporates’ top expectations1  Expectation fulﬁllment2   Piloting   Revenue/new business   Cultural shift   Access to talent via acquisition or hiring  Access to products/IP/ technology/data   Employer branding   Tech and market scouting   Increased shareholder value   Operational improvement of core business   Digital transformation  43%  39%  28%  27%  24%  23%  23%  18%  18%  18%  49%  45%  47%  35%  52%  44%  58%  44%  47%  55%  Source: BCG analysis.

Surveyed startups are highly dis- satisfied with the technical knowledge, access  to data and IP, and facilities that corporates  have given them, and with the funding  support that they receive.   most responsible for causing partnerships to  fail, startups and corporates do concur in  identifying three factors as being comparably  important: hard and time-consuming decision  making, mismatched or nontransparent  expectations, and inability or unwillingness  to move at the same speed. (See Exhibit 7.)   Expectations vary depending on the startup’s  maturity. Preseed startups are the ones most  in need of a reputational boost and support  in developing their offering. Meanwhile,  seed-funded startups are very concerned  about follow-up funding and gaining market  access to increase sales. The most mature   series A and B startups need to boost sales  further and often want to improve their of- fering by using the partner’s expertise and  production facilities.   Noting Reasons for Dissatisfaction  Helps Avoid Misunderstandings To make corporate-startup partnerships work  in the future, both sides need to understand  what is not working today. Although they do  not universally agree about what factors are   Each side also lists several reasons for failure  that the other does not. While startups cite  corporates’ inability to adapt their mindset  and culture as a major impediment, cor- porates are dissatisfied with the startups’  inadequate appreciation and lack of clear  steering and governance.   Increasingly, however, corporate-startup col- laborations are paying more attention to  these issues in order to head off problems  down the road: “It is key to put yourself into  each other’s shoes to understand the other  party’s position and prevent mistakes up  front. We always ask ourselves, ‘What could  the corporate want from us?’ before the first  meeting,” says Goran Maric. Corporates ex- press similar insights. “The most successful  collaboration is grounded in each side’s un-  Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 13   derstanding of where they really excel and  how they can deliver benefit to each other,”  says Christoph Keese, CEO of Axel Springer   hy GmbH, the company’s digital transforma- tion unit, and the author of Silicon Germany.

Corporates  Startups  Large gaps between corporates and startups  14 | After the Honeymoon Ends   THREE FACTORS  FOR SUCCESS  Every collaboration presents its own   unique challenges and opportunities.   Nevertheless, we have identified three  approaches that can help partners in any  collaboration get more out of the relation- ship: have a clear, shared rationale for the  collaboration; adopt an investor mindset; and  create links to the core business. Although  our survey focused on Germany, Austria, and  Switzerland, we have observed similar  relationship patterns around the globe in our  work with clients. Moreover, all three ap- proaches apply to both the corporate side of  the partnership and the startup side.   Have a Clear, Shared Rationale  for the Collaboration  Before entering into any agreement, both  sides need to ensure that they share a ratio- nale and a consistent set of expectations for  the deal, agree on the resources and expertise  that each will bring to the table, and align on  the rules that they will follow to deliver on  those expectations. “The context for why  both parties enter into a collaboration is   extremely important so that the long-term   vision evolves correctly for both sides,” notes  Max Viessmann.   Aligning on the rationale for a collaboration  is trickier than it might seem. “Corporates  tend to have limited visions for their future,  as they are stuck in their daily operations. In   contrast, startups often tend to think aggres- sively toward the future, and so focus on  market disruption. Sitting together and  aligning on a common vision is key,” says  Paul Crusius, managing director and co- founder of audibene.  To this end, transparency is vital. For exam- ple, Amorelie conducts vision workshops with  potential partners prior to initiating any kind  of intercompany collaboration. Lea-Sophie  Cramer of Amorelie notes that those work- shops are extremely valuable for achieving  alignment with the potential partner on a  common goal. Celonis applies a similar ap- proach, conducting value creation workshops  that CTO Martin Klenk says help build a co- operative environment.  We have identified four basic rationales that  corporates often have for choosing to partner  with startups: protect, optimize, transform,  and grow. The first two rationales relate to  developing the corporate’s existing or core  business, while the last two relate to develop- ing and growing new business.  Protect. In many instances, corporates can  leverage startups to protect their core busi- ness against disruption. The idea is not to  transform and move away from the existing  core business, but to build new business  models, products, or services that support  and protect the core business. The corporate   Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 15   usually controls the startup as majority  shareholder, to ensure the startup’s commit- ment to it. The corporate may achieve direct  control either by acquiring the startup or by  building it in an incubator or an innovation  or digital lab.  For example, Otto Group founded the fashion  and technology startup AboutYou in an effort  to attract a new generation of young custom- ers who shop almost exclusively online, while  continuing to appeal to Otto’s existing base  of customers who shop using both catalogues  and the internet. Appealing to both sets of  customers is critical to Otto’s strategy be- cause, although the legacy business is likely  to persist for decades, the AboutYou model  will probably eventually supplant the tradi- tional business model.   Otto treated the startup as a strategic invest- ment and gave it logistical support and space  to store items, which enabled AboutYou to  scale much faster than it could have done on  its own. Otto also gave AboutYou’s founders  operational freedom, recruited board mem- bers who had experience in the startup eco- system, and welcomed external investors  such as SevenVentures and Bestseller A/S to  expand the customer base, gain market share,  and enter new markets.  Optimize. Corporates can cooperate with  startups to optimize the business in areas  such as R&D, marketing and sales, and  operations. In these cases, corporates act as  clients of the startup and work with it toward  an innovative solution to a very specific  problem. Such partnership arrangements  tend to be nonexclusive (often orchestrated  by a partnership unit) and may or may not  include a CVC investment. The startup’s  main goal in entering this type of partnership  is to land large, well-known clients early on to  boost its reputation, market access, and sales.   For example, former BMW and IDEO employ- ees founded ProGlove in 2014 with venture  capital funding. They developed, designed,  and tested their products in conjunction with  BMW at the company’s Dingolfing plant in  Germany. ProGlove’s wearable products con- tain embedded sensors and scanners that   enable staff to perform warehouse processes   faster and more safely by eliminating the  need to pick up a scanner repeatedly. As a   result of this collaboration, BMW’s global  spare parts distribution center is operating at  a time savings of up to 4,000 minutes per day.   Transform. A corporate can use a startup’s  outsider mindset and new skills to transform  and move away from its core business. André  Schwämmlein, the founder of FlixBus GmbH,  says that “by partnering with startups,  corporates are able to change their culture  and adapt to new ways of working. Corpo- rates see the need to brace themselves  against the pressure of Silicon Valley tech  giants and do so by leveraging startups.”  Given that the startup has the task of trans- forming the corporate’s core, the corporate  usually wants to exercise direct control over  the startup—such as through incubation or  internal acceleration.   In areas such as R&D and  operations, corporates act as  clients of the startup.  For example, Viessmann is on track to be- come a next-generation family business by  transforming itself from a manufacturer of  heating systems into a company that provides  full-fledged, sustainable climate solutions. To  achieve this ambitious vision, the family firm  is leveraging all five types of innovation vehi- cles. It has partnered and invested in a multi- tude of promising startups, including gridX  and Building Radar, through its own venture  capital firms, Vito Ventures and Vito One.  Meanwhile, to enhance the transformation of  its core, it has built companies like Statice  and Snuk from scratch through its company-  building firm WATTx. “Helping early-stage  companies to iterate their product as a lead  customer sometimes leads to close strategic  partnerships,” says Viessmann Group co-CEO  Max Viessmann.   Viessmann understands that making a suc- cessful transformation involves assembling  many puzzle pieces—and that an organiza- tion needs a team to put those pieces together.   16 | After the Honeymoon Ends   The company founded V/CO for this purpose  in 2017. V/CO oversees all digital diversifica- tion and innovation activities and ensures  proper integration of all innovations into  Viessmann. To transform the core, a corpo- rate needs some partners that provide radical  innovations and other partners that bundle  such innovations while keeping the overall  rationale in mind.  Grow. Corporates can work with startups to  grow into areas that are adjacent to their core  businesses. In this case, the corporate may  acquire the startup for its new service,  product, or business model, or it may test the  waters first by making a minority CVC  investment. If the corporate finds the startup  at an early stage of its development, the  corporate may incorporate the startup into its  accelerator prior to acquisition. It can then  integrate the newly acquired firm into its  existing business or let it operate as a stand- alone business unit. Increasingly, however,  corporates are building ventures themselves  to drive growth.  Airbus started UP42 in 2018 as a joint effort  with BCG Digital Ventures to help develop  the growing geospatial solutions market.  UP42 is an open developer and marketplace  platform for building, running, and scaling  geospatial products. The platform offers ac- cess to earth observation and terrestrial data,  provides data processing algorithms, and  gives developers the infrastructure they need  to run their code. UP42 benefits greatly from  the “unfair advantage” that Airbus grants it— specifically, access to high-quality satellite   images and tremendous domain experience  built over decades—and it complements  these key assets with external data and ana- lytics to provide a comprehensive environ- ment for geospatial solutions.  Adopt an Investor Mindset Thanks to the work being done by their CVC  units, many corporates are developing a more  critical investor approach. Even so, most still  lack the investor mindset of a private equity  or venture capital firm on such points as  managing startup portfolios, setting mile- stones, and establishing risk management  guidelines. Some corporates may have M&A   units, but operating them is unlike evaluating  and investing in firms whose size, price tags,  and deal execution speed are on a different  scale. In all too many instances, a lack of  discipline has led corporates to pursue deals  at the expense of serving clear-headed  investment expectations.   The collaboration between audibene, the  largest online retailer of hearing aids, and  Sivantos, a leading global manufacturer of  hearing aids, shows how much an investor  mindset matters for success. EQT, a Swedish  private equity group, was a mediator and in- vestor in the arrangement. EQT had specific,  aggressive goals for the corporate-startup re- lationship, but it was also pragmatic—driven  toward speedy value creation and indifferent  to corporate politics. “We would never have  started a collaboration with Sivantos if EQT  had not been there to bring its investor mind- set to the table,” says audibene’s Paul Crusius.  Most corporates still lack the  investor mindset of a private  equity or venture capital firm.  Moreover, EQT—which as a private equity  firm naturally plans to sell its stake at some  point in the future—offered the startup’s  founders a realistic exit strategy. That, in  turn, encouraged them to team up with  Sivan tos and to keep building the business as  an independently operating part of the com- pany. Ultimately, the deal gave audibene the  freedom to drive its own business forward,  says Crusius.  Among the steps that corporates can take to  develop an investor mindset, five stand out:  define clear investment guidelines; sign a let- ter of intent establishing responsibilities and  decision rights; install active governance and  fast course correction capabilities; grant the  startup access to required resources; and ac- cept that some partnerships will fail.   Define a clear investment rationale and  appropriate guidelines. Corporates and  startups should develop clear investment   Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 17   guidelines (a memorandum of understanding,  for example) prior to confirming the invest- ment. Such guidelines will help them decide  whether to enter into a partnership in cases  where the existence of a shared rationale for  the deal provides an objective argument in its  favor. The guidelines should take into account  such soft (subjective) factors as “Do the two  partners connect with each other?” and “Is  there a strong project sponsor on the corpo- rate side?”   Hard (objective) factors include agreements  on metrics and milestones. Settling on KPIs,  timelines, and milestones up front will help  both sides determine whether a partnership  is failing and, if so, how they can end it. The  appropriate investment guidelines in a  particular case depend on the deal’s specifics  and the startup’s stage of development.   Agreeing up front on metrics  and milestones will help both  sides assess the partnership.  Formalize responsibilities and decision  rights. On the basis of the agreed investment  rationale and guidelines, the partners should  create and sign a letter of intent that lays out  responsibilities and decision rights. Who  decides what? When can each partner act  independently? When do they need to  coordinate and align on decisions? In addi- tion to clarifying responsibilities and decision  rights, the agreement expressly acknowledges  what each party brings to the table.   “It is key not only to create a tangible invest- ment rationale, but also to clearly communi- cate the objectives and specific outcome of a  collaboration. Both parties should therefore  set up and sign a letter of intent regarding  the collaboration to make expectations clear,”  notes Stefan Winners, member of the board  at Hubert Burda Media.  AboutYou CEO Tarek Müller echoes this view:  “The agreement guarantees operational free- dom for the startup. As long as the founder  team operates in line with the agreement,   they have to be free to decide what to do,  whom to hire, how to spend money—and to  advance business as they desire.”  Install active, adaptable governance to suit  startup needs. Corporates and startups need  to monitor KPIs regularly against their  mutual targets so they can correct course and  realign promptly if necessary. Reporting  obligations should not exceed what is truly  necessary, however; otherwise, processes will  slow down and disagreements will fester.  Corporates must accept that different rules  apply to startups for functions such as legal,  compliance, and accounting. “You have to ask  yourself when looking at reporting, what is a  must-have and what is nice-to-have. You do  not want to put unnecessary pressure on  startups,” says Dr. Jan Kemper, managing  director and CFO at Omio. Klaus Entenmann,  president and CEO of Daimler Financial  Services, adds, “a corporation’s regulatory  requirements and processes need to be adapt- ed to a startup framework in order for both  to be successful.”   Grant the startup access to required resourc- es. A corporate should be ready and willing  to make additional investments and devote  other nonfinancial resources to a startup  when the need arises or when well-defined  business opportunities present themselves.  Without quick decision making and funding  transfers, both the startup and the corporate  could miss out. Such resources need not come  from the corporate itself. One alternative is  for the corporate to open the partnership to  new players to add financial and strategic  value—as when VW invited Daimler to take a  stake in Heycar. VW and BCG Digital Ven- tures jointly founded Heycar, an online car  portal, to build a next-generation car-buying  experience in Germany. But in order to scale  the startup faster and further, VW invited  additional strategic investors to participate.  In late 2018, Daimler took a 20% stake,  helping to position Heycar as a high-quality,  brand-neutral platform.   Accept that some partnerships will fail. Most  startups don’t succeed. Corporates must  accept this and be willing to pull the plug and  divest when conditions warrant their doing  so. This reality is difficult for many corporates   18 | After the Honeymoon Ends   to accept, but taking risks and cutting losses  are essential features of the startup culture.   One way for corporates to manage and  spread risk is by taking a portfolio approach  to their partnerships, placing multiple bets  (as private equity and venture capitalist in- vestors do). By treating their investments in  startups as portfolios, corporates can distrib- ute the risk that they are willing to take—a  crucial tactic, given that most startups do not  survive long enough to reach maturity. For a  very large corporate, taking this approach  might mean investing in 30 to 40 startups per  year.  With the right KPIs and goals in place, corpo- rates can decide whether to continue the  partnership or pull the plug—the earlier the  better if it isn’t working out. Venture capital- ists are brutally efficient at this, but corporate  executives are more inclined to delay ending  a partnership, in hopes of not losing face,  hurting their career, or losing budgeting for  the next partnership. “It is especially hard to  let go of collaborations that have been com- municated to the market,” observes Dr. Jan  Kemper.   Create Links to the Core Business Startups prefer to collaborate with corporates  rather than venture capitalists for one reason:  they want to secure the “unfair advantage”  that corporates give them over other startups.  Corporates can grant startups access to sales  channels, difficult-to-acquire customers, facili- ties, data and IP, industry and business exper- tise, deep technology understanding, corpo- rate networks, and much more—benefits that  no purely financial investor can match.   To persuade startups to collaborate, corpo- rates should identify the internal capabilities  they possess that are valuable to startups— and they should be prepared to grant startups  access to those capabilities when the time  comes. These direct links to the core business  and the competitive edge that they create for  startups can drive success for both sides. For  corporates, the arrangement is far more ad- vantageous than funding or hiring the startup  as a service provider would be. Nevertheless,  corporates must be realistic about the divi-  sion of responsibilities. “The corporate is re- sponsible for identifying what the startup can  do better than the core business. How to  transfer this into the core and advance it is  the role of the corporate, not the startup. It is  a misconception for the corporate to expect  that the startup drives the digitization of  their core business,” says Lea-Sophie Cramer  of Amorelie.  Setting up a link to the core  business is difficult for both  the corporate and the startup.  Unfortunately, setting up a link to the core  business is difficult—and the effort is not  always successful—for both the corporate  and the startup. Potential impediments  include limited buy-in on the corporate side,  the inherent complexity of processes, internal  regulations, and slow decision making. In- stilling the right mindset is vital, since some  employees might otherwise resist creating  these direct links, especially if they are being  asked to help disrupt their own business.  “Management must take away the fear of  everything that is new from the organization.  This requires classic change management and  is essential for leveraging the core business,”  says Dr. Jan Kemper.   At the same time, corporates need to devote  adequate human resources to the project.  “You need a critical mass of people willing  and capable to understand new business  models and interaction with startups. Sup- port from top management is mandatory, but  not sufficient to drive change,” says Dr. Ulrich  Schmitz. The issue involves not only what to  share but also how to share. Ideally a dedi- cated team and platform will coordinate  stakeholders across the enterprise to ensure   a smooth, standardized working relationship  that does not frustrate startup operations with  poor communication and time-consuming   approvals. “Corporates need a systematic   approach for collaborations—and they need  to scale the approach to create a real impact  over time,” says Dr. Florian Heinemann,  founding partner of Project A.   Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 19   One example is George, a digital banking  platform maintained by Erste Group Bank AG  in Austria. George Labs, a digital research and  innovation lab, created George as a platform  that is open to external partners, service pro- viders, and fintech startups. Its millions of  customers can use it to choose various digital  banking services.  Corporates also need to institutionalize a  clear interface that the startup can use to  connect with the core. Corporates do not want  to set up new legal processes for each new  partnership, nor do they want to have to win  over the necessary corporate stakeholders for   each new partnership. As Stefan Winners  notes, “Prior to investing in or starting a col- laboration, the corporate must be sure how to  integrate the startup into complex corporate  structures.”  Finally, in any technical discussion about  linking to the core, remember that the long- term health of any relationship depends on  the multitude of casual interactions that   occur every day. These can either build up  animosity over time or constantly reinforce  the value that each partner sees in the other.  (See the sidebar “Establish Mutual Respect.”)  ESTABLISH MUTUAL RESPECT   • Be supportive and enthusiastic. The   entire top management team and  supervisory board must be fully com- mitted to the partnership, and the  partnership must have a specific  senior-level champion. In addition, the  hands-on junior employees on both  sides need to have good chemistry.    • Communicate as equal partners. Avoid  power games. Build a shared vision of  the future together, articulate it, and  regularly make time to discuss your  outlook. Mutual appreciation is key.  Startups don’t want to be treated as  toys—and corporates don’t want to be  viewed as graveyards of originality and  innovation.  Establishing a strong foundation for a  partnership is vital, but so is properly  handling day-to-day casual interactions.  Such interactions can either continually  strengthen the partnership or gradually  erode goodwill and trust. Keeping a few  fundamentals in mind can help keep the  relationship on track:   • Embrace the differences. The rationale   for the relationship is that each side  brings different strengths to the table.  Embrace that and accept the other’s  ways of working. On the one hand,  corporates must take care not to stifle  the startup with corporate processes.  On the other hand, startups must  accept that corporates cannot match  them in speed because they have to  manage fully grown structures and  large resources. Before formalizing the  collaboration, prospective partners  should talk to other corporates and  startups to get a keener understanding  of the inherent differences in the two  types of companies.   20 | After the Honeymoon Ends   THE FUTURE OF  COLLABORATION  We asked companies how they think   corporate-startup collaborations will   develop over the next five years. Interestingly,  startups tended to be far more optimistic  than corporates: 86% of startups said that  they expect the number of partnerships to  increase in the next three years, and 55% of  corporates agreed.   Looking ahead to the next five to ten years,  51% of corporates and 58% of startups believe  that corporates will institutionalize collabo- ration. More than half of the corporates sur- veyed want to work with startups, although a  large minority may be playing it too safe and  still do not fully realize how much they will  need to adapt to operate successfully in a  faster, more agile digital world. “Our industry  is conservative; we never had requests from  strategic investors from Germany,” says Dirk  Graber, founder and CEO of the online glass- es retailer Mister Spex.   We have identified several trends that we be- lieve will drive future partnerships:    • More Radical Innovation. Few corpo-  rates can radically innovate on their own,  which makes external innovation their  best option. Axel Menneking, managing  director of hub:raum Tech Incubator at  Deutsche Telekom, makes this point  candidly: “Often we just cannot develop  new technologies in-house at the right   speed with the right customer-centric and  competitive mindset. That’s why collabo- rating with startups is so important, even  for a large player like Deutsche Telekom.”   Of the corporates surveyed,  more than half say that they  want to work with startups.   • Accelerated Speed of Change. “As the  world becomes faster, corporates need  more innovations in a shorter time period.  It is not possible to accomplish this alone,”  says Michael Brehm, managing director  and founder of i2x. Dr. Jan Kemper agrees:  “Grand developments that pan out over  ten years just don’t exist anymore. Change  and disruption have become much faster,  and long-term investments are becoming  increasingly difficult. Therefore, you have  to become agile in your way of working as  a corporate. This flexibility is brought to  the organization via startups.”   • Shrinking Barriers to Entry. Digitization   is opening up new markets around the  globe, and corporates are increasingly  eager to enter those markets. This oppor- tunity, along with abundant funding  options through the capital markets, is   Boston Consulting Group  |  BCG Digital Ventures | 21   Combining the assets of large corporates   with the speed and creativity of startups  has tremendous productive potential. More- over, new beginnings have an inherent attrac- tion that brings passionate intensity to many  such relationships. But once the honeymoon  is over and real life kicks in, the foundation  of the relationship must be strong to endure.  Today, with their long history of reinvention,  European companies have learned valuable  lessons about what makes partnerships suc- ceed or fail, and best practices have emerged  that show both sides how to make partner- ships more successful.   Both sides still have homework to do. Corpo- rates and startups need to develop clear in- vestment rationales, corporates need to adopt  an investor’s mindset, and both sides need to  institutionalize effective ways to link startups  to the corporates’ core business. Collaborating  companies must design pilotable use cases,  demonstrate added value, and work transpar- ently along KPIs and milestones to ensure a  good working relationship.  Accomplishing those tasks will take some  hard work, but companies that succeed will  be strongly positioned to withstand competi- tive pressures and market disruptions. As  Christoph Keese puts it, “Leveraging startups  for innovation is not a new management  trend that will be replaced by another trend  in a couple of years; it is the new operating  system.”  spurring corporates to partner with  startups to protect, optimize, transform,  and grow. “The trend will continue.  Digitization empowers business models  that are easy to roll out and scale. The  barriers to entry are low and will progres- sively become lower still,” says Clemens  Müller of the Erste Group.    • Need to Scale Fast. Corporate partners  can help startups scale faster than finan- cial investors can, by providing them with  an “unfair advantage.” Startups are keenly  aware of this. “We like to say: If you want  to run fast, run alone; if you want to run  far, run together,” says Goran Maric.   • Growing Experience with Collabora-  tions. Corporates have had to deal with a  steep learning curve over the past few  years, but the experience has helped them  gain confidence in their ability to make  corporate-startup collaborations work. Dr.  Christian Langer, VP for digital strategy at  Lufthansa Group, says, “We got used to  each other. Startups are now more  mature; both parties have a better idea of  what they want and what’s possible.”   • Willingness to Cooperate. Corporates  are increasingly willing to set aside their  rivalries and combine efforts in corporate  venturing and other innovation vehicles.  In the next five to ten years, 54% of  corporates and 53% of startups agree that  corporates will combine their efforts in  corporate venturing. “Corporates should  adopt the same strategy as Softbank and  combine forces with other corporates or  investors to successfully play in the big  league of startups,” Klaus Hommels of  Lakestar says. “If something is going well  and you want it to go really well, then you  need to ask yourself: what ownership  structure will help the startup most?  Sometimes this implies opening it up to  other players,” says Sebastian Klauke,  CDO of Otto Group.  22 | After the Honeymoon Ends   FOR FURTHER READING  Boston Consulting Group has  published other reports and  articles, including the following  ones, on related topics.

The Next Normal  The recovery will   be digital  Digitizing at speed and scale  August 2020   Introduction  Welcome to the “next normal”—the new reality emerging from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. How will life,  public health, and business continue to change? We’ve chronicled our response in a wide-ranging series of  publications—more than 500 articles and counting since the outbreak began.  This volume is the first of five edited collections produced to accompany our multimedia series, airing on  CNBC, examining the forces and themes shaping the next normal.    This collection focuses on the vital role of digital in today’s businesses. Many organizations were already  in the throes of digital transformations pre-pandemic, before COVID-19 accelerated the pace of business  across the globe. Some sped up efforts already under way; others implemented digital capabilities for the  first time—as a matter of survival.   In these pages, we have collected some of the best insights we published during these hectic months—  on how top executives have led on digital initiatives, what specific companies across industries have done  differently, and the special challenge of cybersecurity. We have also included content that has resonated  particularly powerfully on McKinsey.com, plus a number of articles authored by Kate Smaje, global leader   of McKinsey Digital and anchor of the digital segment of our multimedia series on CNBC. We hope you find  these insights useful as you continue to navigate your way into the evolving next normal.  Over the next few months, look for additional collections to accompany this digital compendium and  complement forthcoming segments on CNBC. Topics include organization, transformation, sustainability,  and resilience. You can download this and other collections in this series as they become available at   McKinsey.com/thenextnormal, where you will also find our entire collection of coronavirus-related insights.

You’ve probably even told your organization to get  you there already. So why is your move to the cloud1  coming along so slowly, even though you may have  been talking about it for years? It might be because  you and your management team have yet to take a  sufficiently active role, or provide the air cover your  chief information officer (CIO) and chief technology  officer (CTO) need.  CIOs and CTOs are on the front foot right now thanks  to their crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic.  That makes this a good moment to further elevate  top-team support for the cloud enablement needed  to accelerate digital strategy, the digitization of the  company, its channels of distribution, and its supply  chains—all of which already needed to be moving  more quickly than they were.   The CEO’s role is crucial because no one else can  broker across the multiple parties involved, which  include the CIO, CTO, CFO, chief human-resources  officer (CHRO), chief information security officer  (CISO), and business-unit leads. As we explain in this  article, the transition to cloud computing represents  a collective-action problem—one that requires a  coordinated effort across the team at the top of an  organization. It’s a matter of orchestration, in other  words, and only CEOs can wield the baton.  To get to cloud more quickly, CEOs should ask their  CIO and CTO what support they need to lead the  organization on the journey. Chances are good that  three interventions will emerge:  1.  establishing a sustainable funding model to   support the investments required to get business  value from the cloud  2.  developing a new business-technology operating  model2 that exploits cloud for speed, agility, and  efficient scalability  3.  putting in place the HR, compensation, and   location policies required to attract and retain the  specialized engineering talent required to operate  in the cloud   Together, these interventions will help the executive  team unite around a coherent point of view about  the business-driven value that the cloud represents,  how to capture that value, and how to evolve the  company’s operating model accordingly. Without  this perspective, your company may continue to  move too slowly toward cloud computing3 for a  post-COVID-19 “next normal”—creating the risk of  disruption from nimbler attackers.  Invest for business value During the past 20 years, IT organizations have  adopted a range of innovations—for example,  virtualization and Linux—that have made running  business applications much cheaper and that have  required only modest investments. Cloud adoption  has a different economic profile. While exploiting  cloud requires investment in building capabilities and  migration applications, it’s more efficient in the long  term, sometimes markedly so for companies that  have not fully optimized their technology environment.  The biggest benefits accrue to the business from  faster time-to-market, simplified innovation, easier  scalability, and reduced risk. Cloud platforms can  help deploy new digital customer experiences in  days rather than months and can support analytics  that would be uneconomical or simply impossible  with traditional technology platforms.  Unfortunately, technology-funding mechanisms  can stymy cloud adoption—they prioritize features  requested by the business now rather than  critical infrastructure investments that will allow  companies to add functionality more quickly and  easily in the future. Each new bit of tactical business  functionality built without best-practice cloud   1   In this article, we use “cloud” to refer to the public cloud rather than companies’ private clouds, in which they attempt to create highly automated  and virtualized application-hosting environments on premises. 2  An integrated operating model organizes technology teams around user-facing products and the underlying platforms that enable them. For  more, see Ross Frazier, Naufal Khan, Gautam Lunawat, and Amit Rahul, “Products and platforms: Is your technology operating model ready?,”  February 2020, McKinsey.com. 3  Nagendra Bommadevara, James Kaplan, and Irina Starikova, “Leaders and laggards in enterprise cloud infrastructure adoption,” October  2016, McKinsey.com.  Three actions CEOs can take to get value from cloud computing  7   architectures adds to your technical debt4—and  thus to the complexity of building and implementing  anything in the future.  CEOs can help the senior team recognize that  infrastructure investments in cloud platforms  represent a source of competitive advantage rather  than a cost to be managed. Once the top team gets  that right, a lot else falls into place, including your  technology-funding process, which begins shifting  toward products or platforms rather than projects.  Projects are one-time investments funded in a yearly  boom-and-bust cycle. Products in general (and cloud  platforms in particular) require more stable, ongoing  funding and consistent “ownership” to optimize new  functionality and mitigate technical debt.   The top-team conversation will benefit, too, from  a prioritized, sometimes multiyear road map  of domains in which the cloud will accelerate  performance and digital transformation. This will  help prioritize investments—and avoid defaulting to  applications that are technically easiest to migrate.  By asking which business domains (such as order  capture, billing, or supply-chain optimization)  would benefit most from the speed, innovation, and  scalability that cloud platforms can provide, top  teams can arrive at the highest-priority areas for  movement to the cloud.  Inevitably, resource-allocation issues will arise.  Growth businesses, for example, may be most likely  to benefit from the cloud, but they are the least  likely to have high margins or excess cash to pony  up for a cloud investment. More mature business  units may have higher margins, but where, exactly,  should they get the money needed for the cloud—by  spending less on tactical functionality this year and  next, or by reducing marketing expenditure? Does  a legacy business have the legs to support a long- lived cloud investment? Should the CEO transfer  money from one business unit to another, or accept  lower margins when a business invests in the cloud?  Such questions are unlikely to be asked, much less  answered, without serious engagement from the  CEO and other members of the top team.  A big financial-information provider, for example,  determined that moving applications in its customer-  facing business domains to the public cloud could  enable much faster and less expensive entry into  promising markets. Hosting these applications in  the cloud meant that technology operations in a  new country could be set up in a couple of weeks at  a negligible cost, versus a couple of million dollars  of up-front investment for each country. A health- insurance carrier, meanwhile, examined its current  project portfolio and found that it could speed up the  capture of several billion dollars in additional revenue  by adopting the cloud. Moving the systems that help  the insurer interact with healthcare providers was  especially attractive because of the opportunity to  accelerate the onboarding of new providers.   Then, once the investment is made, it’s up to the  CEO to demand higher business performance in  return for the cloud investment—no more deflecting  blame for subpar outcomes to a subpar technology  environment. If the strategic case for the cloud is  real, it should translate into better performance. The  CEO must demand that it does.   A new operating model Once the funding model is straightened out,  companies must ground the new partnership  between IT and the businesses in an operating  model that reflects and supports their growing  investment in the cloud.   Here, it will help to think about an integrated system  rather than a set of individual technologies. Doing  so implies organizational change across all of  IT, and many of the business units and functions  as well. This operating model combines cloud- based digital technologies and agile operational  capabilities in an integrated, well-sequenced  approach that can rapidly accelerate digital strategy  and transformation. The model helps to coordinate  end-to-end operations across silos—supporting  customer and employee journeys, for instance— while taking technology out of quarantine and  making the most of it across all lines of business.   A cloud-ready business-technology operating  model has many requirements. Here, we focus on  the few that need intervention from the CEO.  8  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   If your company is to gain value from  the cloud, your IT department must   become more agile, if it isn’t already.   Improving business interaction Achieving the speed and agility that cloud platforms  promise requires frequent interaction—for instance,  to define and optimize customer journeys— between IT managers and their counterparts in the  business units and functions, particularly those  who own products and capability areas. CEOs  need to encourage business leaders to appoint  knowledgeable decision makers as product owners  for each business capability.   Too often, business units appoint product owners  who are too new or too junior, and who lack either  the knowledge or the organizational throw-weight  to make their decisions stick. Many of these product  or capability owners are “process jockeys,” whose  expertise is coordinating stakeholders and tasks.  Look instead for more senior folks capable of  thinking broadly and strategically.   Going agile in IT If your company is to gain value from the cloud, your IT  department must become more agile, if it isn’t already.  That involves more than moving development teams  to agile product models. Agile IT also means bringing  agility to your IT infrastructure and operations by  transforming infrastructure and security teams from  reactive, “ticket driven” operations into proactive  models in which scrum teams develop the application  program interfaces (APIs) that service businesses  and developers can consume.   Counterintuitively, you should avoid inserting  translators between IT and the businesses. Instead,  look to organizational groupings that unite business,  technology, governance, process, and people  management. These quickly moving modular   platforms should be run by a platform owner who  takes end-to-end responsibility for providing a  solution and operating the platform as a service.  Accounting for the risks Everything in enterprise technology implies risk.  To mitigate security, resiliency, and compliance  concerns relating to the adoption of the cloud,  companies must be clear-eyed about these risks.  Among other things, that means holding rigorous  discussions about the best mechanisms for aligning  the appetite for risk with decisions about the  technology environment. Getting the organization  to take the right tone on risk will require particular  attention from the CEO. It’s easy to let worries about  security, resiliency, and compliance stop a cloud  program in its tracks. Instead of letting risks derail  progress, CEOs should insist on a pragmatic risk  appetite that reflects the business strategy, while  placing the risks of cloud computing in the context  of the existing risks of on-premises computing and  demanding options for mitigating risks in the cloud.  Companies that get the operating model right  can see dramatic improvements. These include  better target-state economics and lower transition  costs. They will also see improved agility and  ability to innovate. One natural-resource company  implemented agile ways of working for business- application development, infrastructure, and  security. In particular, it invested in creating  automated, API-based services that developers  could use to provision workloads on cloud platforms  securely and resiliently. As a result, the company  started releasing new capabilities in days rather  than months, while limiting risk and technical debt.  Three actions CEOs can take to get value from cloud computing  9   Revisit talent As your cloud investment picks up speed, supported  by a new, cloud-ready operating model, your CIO  will no doubt be asking for the talent needed for  cloud. Although cloud computing can dramatically  boost the productivity of technology, it requires  specialized and sometimes hard-to-find technical  talent—full-stack developers, data engineers,  cloud-security engineers, identity- and access- management specialists, and cloud engineers.  Such talent can be hired externally or upskilled  from within. Just make sure current HR policies  and approaches don’t hobble your approach. The  basis of performance management and promotion,  for example, should be expertise rather than the  number of direct reports someone oversees.   If your HR policies are not up to speed, you may  need to provide some air cover for your CIO with  the CHRO. Some policies, put in place a decade  ago to contain IT costs, can get in the way of  onboarding cloud talent. Over the years, companies  have adopted policies that limit costs per head  and the number of senior hires, for example, and  that require the use of outsourced resources in  low-cost locations. Collectively, these policies  produce the reverse of what the cloud requires,  which are relatively small numbers of highly talented  and expensive people who may not want to live  in traditional low-cost IT locations. The location  issue is why CEOs who are serious about the cloud  have suggested that their CHROs reverse policies  encouraging the use of low-cost, commoditized tech  talent. In some cases, this new direction takes the  form of newly established tech centers, in places  such as the US West Coast, which are specifically  designed to attract cloud talent.  CEOs must also make sure their technology  leaders get sufficient voice in senior forums and  management process given the increasingly fast  integration of digital and business strategy. At many  companies, CIOs and CTOs have been among the   heroes of the COVID-19 response by pivoting their  organizations to enable pervasive remote working,  often in a matter of days. The cloud allows CIOs and  CTOs to play an even more critical role in making  business strategies successful.   Compared with traditional IT managers, successful  CIOs and CTOs in this environment will be both more  plugged into a company’s digital transformation and  more technologically savvy. In a post-COVID-19 next  normal, these executives cannot rely on vendors to  figure everything out for them. They must be open to  new ideas and willing to learn, to take risks, and to fail  fast and then quickly correct course when necessary.  It helps if they’re compelling communicators who can  inspire both business partners and their own teams to  undertake dramatic change.  The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the  need for companies to adopt digital business  models—and only cloud platforms can provide the  agility, scalability, and innovation required for this  transition. Although there have been frustrations  and false starts in the enterprise journey to the  cloud, companies can dramatically accelerate their  progress by focusing investments in it where they  will provide the most business value and by building  cloud-ready operating models.   But they have to get there first. And that’s where  CEOs have an important role to play—first by  becoming more technologically savvy than they  have been in the past and next by addressing the  collective-action problem that often prevents  companies from embracing new strategic roles  for IT. If companies are to be successful in a digital  next normal, their CEOs must ensure that their  management teams understand the specific ways  that cloud computing can raise revenue growth and  margins and how, in close alignment, those teams  will rally to capture value.

Businesses that once  mapped digital strategy in one- to three-year  phases must now scale their initiatives in a matter of  days or weeks.   those that position you for a postcrisis world. In this  world, some things will snap back to previous form,  while others will be forever changed. Playing it safe  now, understandable as it might feel to do so, is  often the worst option.   In one European survey, about 70 percent of  executives from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland  said the pandemic is likely to accelerate the pace  of their digital transformation. The quickening is  evident already across sectors and geographies.  Consider how Asian banks have swiftly migrated  physical channels online. How healthcare providers  have moved rapidly into telehealth, insurers into  self-service claims assessment, and retailers into  contactless shopping and delivery.   The COVID-19 crisis seemingly provides a sudden  glimpse into a future world, one in which digital  has become central to every interaction, forcing  both organizations and individuals further up the  adoption curve almost overnight. A world in which  digital channels become the primary (and, in some  cases, sole) customer-engagement model, and  automated processes become a primary driver of  productivity—and the basis of flexible, transparent,  and stable supply chains. A world in which agile  ways of working are a prerequisite to meeting  seemingly daily changes to customer behavior.  If a silver lining can be found, it might be in the falling  barriers to improvisation and experimentation  that have emerged among customers, markets,  regulators, and organizations. In this unique  moment, companies can learn and progress more  quickly than ever before. The ways they learn from  and adjust to today’s crisis will deeply influence  their performance in tomorrow’s changed world,  providing the opportunity to retain greater agility as  well as closer ties with customers, employees, and  suppliers. Those that are successfully able to make  gains “stick” will likely be more successful during  recovery and beyond.  Now is the time to reassess digital initiatives— those that provide near-term help to employees,  customers, and the broad set of stakeholders to  which businesses are increasingly responsible and   A crisis demands boldness and learning Every company knows how to pilot new digital  initiatives in “normal” times, but very few do so at the  scale and speed suddenly required by the COVID-19  crisis. That’s because in normal times, the customer  and market penalties for widespread “test and learn”  can seem too high, and the organizational obstacles  too steep. Shareholders of public companies  demand immediate returns. Finance departments  keep tight hold of the funds needed to move new  initiatives forward quickly. Customers are often  slow to adjust to new ways of doing things, with  traditional adoption curves reflecting this inherent  inertia. And organizational culture, with its deeply  grooved silos, hinders agility and collaboration. As  a result, companies often experiment at a pace  that fails to match the rate of change around them,  slowing their ability to learn fast enough to keep  up. Additionally, they rarely embrace the bold action  needed to move quickly from piloting initiatives  to scaling the successful ones, even though  McKinsey research shows bold moves to adopt  digital technologies early and at scale, combined  with a heavy allocation of resources against digital  initiatives and M&A, correlate highly with value  creation (Exhibit 1).   As the COVID-19 crisis forces your customers,  employees, and supply chains into digital channels  and new ways of working, now is the time to ask  yourself: What are the bold digital actions we’ve  hesitated to pursue in the past, even as we’ve known  they would eventually be required? Strange as it may  seem, right now, in a moment of crisis, is precisely  the time to boldly advance your digital agenda.   A mandate to be bold What does it mean to act boldly? We suggest four  areas of focus, each of which goes beyond applying  “digital lipstick” and toward innovating entirely new  digital offerings, deploying design thinking and   12  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   COVID Digital Strategy Exhibit 1 of 3  Exhibit 1 Bold, tightly integrated digital strategies are the most e(cid:14)ective approach to  digital transformations.

New offerings By now you’ve likely built the minimally viable nerve  center you need to coordinate your crisis response.  This nerve center provides a natural gathering point  for crucial strategic information, helping you stay  close to the quickly evolving needs of core customer  segments, and the ways in which competitors and  markets are moving to meet them. Mapping these  changes helps address immediate risks, to be sure,  but it also affords looking forward in time at bigger  issues and opportunities—those that could drive  significant disruption as the crisis continues. Just   as digital platforms have disrupted value pools and  value chains in the past, the COVID-19 crisis will set  similar “ecosystem”-level changes in motion, not  just changes in economics but new ways of serving  customers and working with suppliers across  traditional industry boundaries.   In the immediate term, for example, most  organizations are looking for virtual replacements  for their previously physical offerings, or at least  new ways of making them accessible with minimal  physical contact. The new offerings that result  can often involve new partnerships or the need to  access new platforms and digital marketplaces in  which your company has yet to participate.

Organizations that make minor  changes to the edges of their business model  nearly always fall short of their goals. Tinkering  leads to returns on investment below the cost of  capital and to changes (and learning) that are too  small to match the external pace of disruption. In  particular, organizations rapidly adopting AI tools  and algorithms, as well as design thinking, and using  those to redefine their business at scale have been  outperforming their peers. This will be increasingly  true as companies deal with large amounts of data  in a rapidly evolving landscape and look to make  rapid, accurate course corrections compared with  their peers.   While the outcomes will vary significantly by  industry, a few common themes are emerging  across sectors that suggest “next normal”   changes to cost structures and operating   models going forward.   — Supply-chain transparency and flexibility. Near-  daily news stories relate how retailers around  the globe are experiencing stock-outs during  the crisis, such as toilet-paper shortages in the  United States. It’s also clear that retailers with  full supply-chain transparency prior to the crisis— as well as algorithms to detect purchase-pattern  changes—have done a better job navigating  during the crisis. Other sectors, many of which  are experiencing their own supply-chain  difficulties during the crisis, can learn from their  retail counterparts to build the transparency and   flexibility needed to avoid (or at least mitigate )  supply-chain disruption in the future.    — Data security. Security has also been in the   news, whether it’s the security of people  themselves or that of goods and data. Zoom  managed to successfully navigate the rapid  scaling of its usage volume, but it also ran into  security gaps that needed immediate address.  Many organizations are experiencing similar,  painful lessons during this time of crisis.    — Remote workforces and automation. Another   common theme emerging is the widely held  desire to build on the flexibility and diversity  brought through remote working. Learning how  to maintain productivity—even as we return  to office buildings after the lockdown ends,  and even as companies continue to automate  activities—will be critical to capturing the most  value from this real-world experiment that is  occurring. In retail, for example, there has been   widespread use of in-store robots to take over  more transactional tasks like checking inventory  in store aisles and remote order fulfillment.  These investments won’t be undone postcrisis,  and those that have done so will find themselves  in advantaged cost structure during the recovery.   Boldly evolve your business portfolio  No company can accelerate the delivery of all its  strategic imperatives without looking to mergers  and acquisitions (M&A) to speed them along. This  is particularly true with digital strategy, where   Digital strategy in a time of crisis  15   M&A can help companies gain talent and build  capabilities, even as it offers access to new  products, services, and solutions, and to new  market and customer segments.  More broadly, we know from research into economic  downturns that companies that invest when valuations  are low outperform those that do not. These  companies divested underperforming businesses   10 percent faster than their peers early on in a crisis (or  sometimes in anticipation of a crisis) and then shifted  gears into M&A at the first sign of recovery.   In more normal times, one of the main challenges  companies face in their digital transformations is  the need to acquire digital talent and capabilities  through acquisitions of tech companies that are  typically valued at multiples that capital markets  might view as dilutive to the acquirer. The current  downturn could remove this critical roadblock,  especially with companies temporarily free from  the tyranny of quarterly earnings expectations.  Because valuations are down, the crisis and its  immediate aftermath may prove an opportune time  to pick up assets that were previously out of reach.  We are already seeing many private-equity firms  actively looking to deploy large swaths of capital.    Learning at the pace of crisis Moving boldly doesn’t mean moving thoughtlessly,  however. Bold action and the ability to learn are  highly interrelated. The real-time ability to learn   during a crisis is in fact the one ingredient that can  turbocharge your ability to scale quickly.  Find a new cadence  In situations of extreme uncertainty, leadership  teams need to learn quickly what is and is not  working and why. This requires identifying and  learning about unknown elements as quickly as  they appear. Prior to the crisis, leading companies  had already been increasing the cadence of their  learning as part of a quickened organizational  metabolism (Exhibit 3). Companies can look to their  example as they work to adapt to change more  rapidly during crisis times—and beyond.   Four areas of intervention can help companies learn  more quickly during the crisis and the next normal  that follows.  Quicken your data reviews Start by evaluating the frequency with which you  review the available data. You should be reviewing  multiple sources of data on a weekly (or more  frequent) basis to evaluate the shifting needs of  your customers and business partners—as well as  your own performance. Look to your crisis nerve  center as a single source of truth for newly emerging  data about your employees, your customers, your  channel partners, your supply chains, and the  ecosystems in which your company participates.  Then turn to secure file-sharing technologies to  remotely share and discuss insights from this faster  pace of data review.   Because valuations are down, the crisis  and its immediate aftermath may prove  an opportune time to pick up assets that  were previously out of reach.  16  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   COVID Digital Strategy Exhibit 3 of 3  Exhibit 3 The COVID-19 crisis is causing a need for acceleration beyond what we had  seen before, going from three tiers of speed down to two.

The question also asked about the  frequency of evaluating M&A opportunities as part of strategy-setting discussions. These responses are not shown, because M&A typically  requires a longer time frame than the other 10 operational practices tested, often due to regulatory reasons.  Focus on technology  The abrupt shift to virtual operations and interactions,  both inside and outside your organization, also  provides an opportunity to accelerate your pace of  learning about, and adoption of, technologies with  which your organization might have only begun to  experiment. As experimentation scales, so does  learning. The rapid shift to digital can also reveal  potential trouble spots with your organization’s  current technology stack, giving you a sneak preview   of how well your technology “endowment” is likely  to perform going forward. Here are some factors to  keep an eye on as you more quickly learn about and  adopt new technologies:   — Data security. Are you experiencing breaches as   you move to remote working and data sharing?   — Scalability. Where are the breaks and crashes  happening as 100 percent of your interactions   Digital strategy in a time of crisis  17   with customers, employees, and business  partners go virtual?   — Usability. Right now customers and business  partners often have little choice but to access  your products or services through your new  digital offerings. Their options will expand as we  move beyond the crisis. How well will your new  offerings stand up? If your current usability is low,  experiment to improve it now, while you still have a  captive audience to partner with and learn from.  Test and learn  In normal times, experimentation might sometimes  seem a risky game. Changing the working models to  which employees, customers, or business partners  are accustomed can seem to risk pushing them  away, even when those experiments take aim at  longer-term gains for all concerned. The COVID-19  crisis, however, has made experimentation both a  necessity and an expectation.   Start with the customer-facing initiatives that, while  more complex, offer a larger upside. Use automation  and predictive analytics to quickly and effectively  isolate difficulties. Look for opportunities to  standardize what you’re learning to support scaling  digital solutions across core business processes.  Standardization can help accelerate projects by  reducing confusion and creating common tools that  broad groups of people can use.  Learning while scaling  As companies increase their rate of metabolic  learning, they need to quickly translate what  they’re learning into at-scale responses. Scaling  what you learn is always an obstacle in a digital  transformation. We’ve had plenty to say regarding  scaling up analytics, scaling up quality, or innovating  at speed and scale. Here we’ll simply highlight the  role learning plays in your ability to scale your   digital initiatives.   normal times, only test one dimension at a time, like  the conversion/engagement/satisfaction rates of  individual customers, the unit economics of a single  transaction, or the user experience of a given digital  solution. Whether they want to or not, companies  in crisis mode find themselves in a different type of  pilot: one of digital programs at massive scale. The  rapid transition to full scale in many types of digital  operations and interfaces has brought with it many  challenges (for example, building and delivering  laptops in under two weeks to all employees to enable  100 percent of them for remote working versus the  10 percent that were previously remote). But it also  brings opportunities. At the broadest level, these  include the prospect for real-time learning about  where value is going in your markets and industry, the  chance to learn and feed back quickly what’s working  in your operations and your agile organizational  approach, and the opportunity to learn where it is  you’re more or less able to move quickly—which can  help inform where you might need to buy a business  rather than build one.  Observing interaction effects Since scaling quickly requires changing multiple  parts of a business model or customer journey  simultaneously, now is a valuable time to observe  the interaction effects among multiple variables.1   For example, healthcare providers are facing an  increased demand for services (including mental  health and other non-COVID-19 presentations) at  the same time that their traditional channels are  restricted, all in the context of strict privacy laws.  This has caused many providers to rapidly test  and adopt telehealth protocols that were often  nonexistent in many medical offices before, and  to navigate privacy compliance as well as patient  receptivity to engaging in these new channels.  Providers are learning which types of conditions  and patient segments they can treat remotely, at the  same time that they’re widely deploying new apps  (such as Yale Medicine’s MyChart) to accelerate the  digital medical treatment of their patients.   While companies frequently pilot new digital initiatives  with the intention of learning from them before they  roll out broadly, these experiments and pilots, in   Similarly, when a retailer rolls out, within a  week, a new app for country-wide, same-day   1 Interaction effects occur when two or more independent variables interact with at least one dependent variable. The effect of all the    interactions together is often either substantially greater (or lesser) than the sum of the parts.      18  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   common solution space, in other words, the more  quickly learning occurs—and the faster performance  improves. Some argue that these network effects  occur in a so-called collaboration curve.  At a time of crisis, changing needs drive rapid  shifts in employee mindsets and behaviors that  play out as a greater willingness to try new things.  Consider how you can best support the ways  your talented employees learn. One option is to  build or tap into platform-based talent markets  that help organizations reallocate their labor  resources quickly when priorities and directions  shift—and help talented employees increase their  rate of learning. Be sure to look not just within  the boundaries of your own company but across  enterprises to include your channel partners, your  vendors, and your suppliers. Chances are they will  be more willing than ever to collaborate and share  data and learnings to better ensure everyone’s  collective survival.   It’s often the case in human affairs that the greatest  lessons emerge from the most devastating times  of crises. We believe that companies that can  simultaneously attend to and rise above the critical  and day-to-day demands of their crisis response can  gain unique insights to both inform their response  and help ensure that their digital future is more  robust coming out of COVID-19 than it was coming in.  delivery, it’s testing far more than one variability  at a time, such as the customer take-up of that  new channel. Because of the scale, it can learn  about differences in adoption and profitability  by region and store format. It can test whether  its technology partners can scale across 1,000  stores. It can test whether its supplier base can  adapt distribution to handle the new model. Shifting  multiple variables simultaneously, however, also  increases the degree of difficulty when it comes to  interpreting the results—because you’re no longer  isolating one variable at a time. Companies who  have already invested in AI capabilities will find  themselves significantly advantaged. Making further  investments now—even if you’ve yet to get going— with continue to pay out postcrisis as well.   Simplify and focus Given the degree of complexity created by scaled  experimentation, organizations need to find ways  to simplify and focus to avoid being overwhelmed.  Some of that is done for them as the crisis closes  many physical channels of distribution and  makes others impossible to access. But further  streamlining is required along the lines of what is  working, what isn’t, and why. This is perhaps the first  global crisis in which companies are in the position  to collect and evaluate real-time data about their  customers and what they are doing (or trying to do)  during this time of forced virtualization. Pruning  activities and offerings that are no longer viable  while aggressively fixing issues that arise with your  offerings will help increase the chance of keeping a  higher share of customers in your lower-cost, digital  channels once the crisis passes  Don’t go it alone Research indicates that people and organizations  learn more quickly as a result of network effects.

Digital strategy in a time of crisis  19   © Dani3315/Getty Images  The COVID-19 recovery   will be digital: A plan for  the first 90 days  The rapid migration to digital technologies driven by the pandemic   will continue into the recovery. Here’s how to accelerate your   organization’s digital capabilities to keep pace.  by Aamer Baig, Bryce Hall, Paul Jenkins, Eric Lamarre, and Brian McCarthy  20   Second, as the economy lurches back, demand  recovery will be unpredictable; uneven across  geographies, sectors, product categories, and  customer segments; and often slow to return  to precrisis levels. While a few sectors will face  unusually strong demand, leaders in many  industries must deal with periods of structural  overcapacity. Those companies face the painful  need to rightsize the cost base and capital of their  operations, supply chains, and organizations overall  and to transition their fixed costs to variable costs  aggressively wherever possible. Complicating  matters for leaders as they grapple with ways to  deal with an uneven recovery is that historical data  and forecasting models will be of little use to predict  where pockets of demand will emerge and where  supply will be necessary. New data and completely  rebuilt analytical models will be essential to steer  operational decisions.   Finally, many organizations have shifted to remote- working models almost overnight. A remote-first  setup allows companies to mobilize global expertise  instantly, organize a project review with 20—or  200—people immediately, and respond to customer  inquiries more rapidly by providing everything from  product information to sales and after-sales support  digitally. In effect, remote ways of working have, at  least in part, driven the faster execution drumbeat  that we’re all experiencing in our organizations.   And this step change in remote adoption is now  arguably substantial enough to reconsider current  business models.   Quickly pivoting the business agenda to address  these changes will be critical for a successful  recovery. Digital will undoubtably play a center- stage role. We offer suggestions for a 90-day   plan to realign the digital agenda and implement   the enablers for acceleration during the recovery  and beyond.  By now, most C-suite executives have led  their companies to digitize at least some part of  their business to protect employees and serve  customers facing mobility restrictions as a result  of the COVID-19 crisis. As one CEO of a large tech  company recently stated, “We are witnessing what  will surely be remembered as a historic deployment  of remote work and digital access to services  across every domain.”   Indeed, recent data show that we have vaulted five  years forward in consumer and business digital  adoption in a matter of around eight weeks. Banks  have transitioned to remote sales and service teams  and launched digital outreach to customers to  make flexible payment arrangements for loans and  mortgages. Grocery stores have shifted to online  ordering and delivery as their primary business.  Schools in many locales have pivoted to 100 percent  online learning and digital classrooms. Doctors  have begun delivering telemedicine, aided by more  flexible regulation. Manufacturers are actively  developing plans for “lights out” factories and  supply chains. The list goes on.  As some regions begin reopening, businesses  are considering how to return to some semblance  of full speed in an unstable environment in which  lockdowns will ease (and potentially be reinstated) in  waves. In doing so, they will need to confront three  structural changes that are playing out.   First, customer behaviors and preferred interactions  have changed significantly, and while they will  continue to shift, the uptick in the use of digital  services is here to stay, at least to some degree  (Exhibit 1). Fully 75 percent of people using digital  channels for the first time indicate that they  will continue to use them when things return to  “normal.”1  Companies will need to ensure that their  digital channels are on par with or better than  those of their competition to succeed in this new  environment. If China offers us any lessons, digital  laggards will be substantially disadvantaged during  the recovery.  1 McKinsey COVID-19 US Digital Sentiment Survey, April 2020.

Employees are already working  fully remotely and are agile to some degree.  Companies have already launched analytics  and artificial-intelligence (AI) initiatives in their  operations. IT teams have already delivered  at a pace they never have before. But for most  companies, the changes to date represent only the  first phase of the changes that will be necessary.  We have laid out an agenda that focuses on  four efforts: refocusing and accelerating digital  investments in response to evolving customer  needs, using new data and AI to improve business  operations, selectively modernizing technology  capabilities to boost development velocity, and  increasing organizational agility to deliver more  quickly. For each one, we outline a practical 90-day  plan to make it happen (Exhibit 2).  Refocus digital efforts toward  changing customer expectations Many companies are accelerating their shifts toward  GES 2020 digital-first models—at warp speed. One European  COVID Digital Exhibit 2 of 3  variety-store chain, for example, established a fully  functioning e-commerce business in just three  months. The online business was interconnected  across all functions (warehousing, merchandising,  marketing, customer support, et cetera) and  improved basket size over physical stores by three  times as well as delivering nearly 3 percent like-for- like revenue growth in its main market.  But it’s not just about digitizing. Companies must  also reimagine customer journeys to reduce friction,  accelerate the shift to digital channels, and provide  for new safety requirements. For example, an  automobile manufacturer now handles functions  traditionally performed by dealers, such as trade- ins, financing, servicing, and home delivery of  cars. Airlines are rapidly reinventing the passenger  experience with contactless journeys focused on  traveler health and safety to make customers feel  comfortable flying again (Exhibit 3).   In the next 90 days. CEOs should ask their business  leaders to assess how the needs and behaviors of  their most important customers have changed and  benchmark their digital channels against those of  their competition. This information should form the   Exhibit 2 A plan for the (cid:19)rst 90 days has four e(cid:12)orts to launch immediately.

Chief digital officers and chief information officers  (CIOs) can then quickly stand up (or refocus) agile  teams to execute the most urgent priorities. A  consumer-electronics company, for example,  recently launched an agile war room to improve  conversion rates on its website traffic. That type  of project can deliver meaningful results in weeks.  Changes that require more fundamental work, like  setting up a new e-commerce channel, will typically  take longer. Continually measuring digital-channel  performance during the 90 days will be critical so  that companies can quickly adapt as they learn  more. Consider setting up a weekly forum for senior  business and technology leaders to process the  learnings coming in and drive the full agenda at pace  and in a coordinated fashion.   Use new data and artificial intelligence  to improve business operations Hundreds of operational decisions get made on  daily, weekly, and monthly bases. Take an airline,  for example, that must make many decisions:  Which routes should we operate? What crew size  GES 2020 is optimal for each flight? How many meals should  COVID Digital we order? What staffing level is necessary in the  Exhibit 3 of 3 contact center?   Modern businesses have several forecasting  and planning models to guide such operational  decisions. Organizations will need to validate these  models. In the same way that many companies  had to rebuild risk and financial models that failed  during the 2008 financial collapse, models will  similarly need to be replaced because of the  massive economic and structural shifts caused by  the pandemic. For example, models that use time- series, oil-price, or unemployment data will need to  be rebuilt entirely. The data must be reevaluated   as well.   As companies construct these models, analytics  teams will likely need to bring together new data  sets and use enhanced modeling techniques to  forecast demand and manage assets successfully.  One automotive-parts supplier, for example,  developed a forecasting model that incorporated  previously unused third-party data. The model will  help the supplier spot potential issues with its own  suppliers’ ability to deliver needed items, offering  a chance to reach out to its suppliers to work out  logistics or find another source.  Other business areas can benefit from more  sophisticated modeling as well. A leading financial- services provider, for example, stood up an  AI-powered solution to generate leads for its    Exhibit 3 The travel industry is mapping out the customer journey to identify points of  health risk and design a contactless experience.

In the next 90 days. As a first step, the chief  analytics officer (or equivalent) should mobilize  an effort to inventory core models that support  business operations and work with business leaders  to prioritize them based on their impact on key  operations and their efficacy drift. This assessment  is urgent and should be completed as quickly as  possible. It will essentially define a program of  quick fixes that the data and analytics team can  undertake, working hand in hand with business and  functional leaders. Once the situation stabilizes,  CEOs and business leaders should push their data  and analytics teams to develop next-generation  models that leverage new data sets and modeling  techniques better suited for fast-changing  environments. The more advanced companies are  already creating synthetic data sets using advanced  machine-learning techniques, such as generative  adversarial networks (GANs) to train new analytical  models when historical data are of little use.   Selectively modernize   technology capabilities Successfully executing the described agenda  requires investment capacity and development  velocity. CIOs can contribute to both by rightsizing  the IT cost structure to new demand levels and  reinvesting the freed-up resources into customer- facing digital solutions and critical decision-support  systems, first and foremost. Companies can also  dedicate some of the savings to modernizing  selectively the technology stack and software- development tooling.   Many companies have found they have the potential  to free up as much as 45 percent of their IT costs  over the course of a year. Our experience suggests  that roughly two-thirds of this potential can be  achieved through measures such as extending  hardware- and software-refresh cycles, rapidly  renegotiating vendor contracts, and restricting cloud  workloads by turning off noncritical jobs. Additional  cuts get deeper into the cost structure and risk  hamstringing future growth. The right balance will   vary by industry, but under any scenario, rightsizing  should expose much needed investment capacity as  quickly as possible to fund the 90-day plan.  As CIOs consider upgrading their tech stacks, two  features of a modern technology environment  are particularly important and can be rapidly  implemented: a cloud-based data platform and an  automated software-delivery pipeline (commonly  called “continuous integration and continuous  delivery”). Without these, development velocity  stalls and becomes mired in complexity. The good  news is that cloud technologies make it possible to  deploy these quickly and at relatively low cost.  In the next 90 days. First, develop the plan to  rightsize and create a more variable cost structure— the faster the better to free up resources for the  digital agenda.   In the second 30-day sprint, choose your cloud  partners. While speed is of the essence, CIOs should  thoughtfully consider the contractual structures  offered by technology providers. Carefully review  those that appear too good to pass up to ensure  that the providers aren’t capturing all the value. And  remember to launch appropriate internal efforts  to train and prepare teams to operate in the new  environment. During this sprint, it’s also time to  modernize the tech stack selectively—“selectively”  being the operative word. Most companies won’t  have the management bandwidth and resources to  take on a full-scale modernization in the next 12 to  18 months. By focusing on setting up or enhancing  a cloud-based data platform and equipping agile  teams with automated software delivery, CIOs can  double, or even triple, development velocity in the  short term.   In the final sprint, it’s a no-brainer to launch the  recruiting of additional digital talent and accelerate  digital upskilling of the entire organization. These  steps will prepare organizations well for a more  substantive modernization of their application  landscapes after recovery. Finally, continue to pay  attention to cybersecurity. Much of the rapid IT work  carried out during the COVID-19 crisis might have  created new cyberrisk exposures.   The COVID-19 recovery will be digital: A plan for the first 90 days  25   Increase the organizational drumbeat The current crisis has forced organizations to adapt  rapidly to new realities, opening everyone’s eyes  to new, faster ways of working with customers,  suppliers, and colleagues. Many CEOs wonder   what it will take to maintain the quickened  organizational drumbeat.   Companies that have led the way in adopting  flatter, fully agile organizational models have shown  substantial improvements in both execution pace  and productivity. This has held true during the crisis,  as we see a direct correlation between precrisis  agile maturity and the time it has taken companies  to launch a first crisis-related product or service.  While many companies have at least a few agile  teams in place, few have successfully scaled to  hundreds of teams staffed with many more “doers”  than “checkers,” which is what’s needed to drive  the accelerated organizational pace the crisis—and  even the next normal—demands.  What can realistically be done in 90 days to increase  the organizational drumbeat? Standing up a digital  factory is largely the best approach right now  because it can be constructed and scaled in three  months or less. Many organizations, from banks to  mining companies, have accelerated and scaled  their digital delivery by establishing these internal  factories, with interdisciplinary teams aligned to  businesses’ digital priorities. One large global bank,  for example, built five such factories to support  several locations across the Americas.   As previously mentioned, remote working can  also help organizations move at a faster clip as  companies tap into new labor pools and specialized  remote expertise. (And, yes, agile can be executed  remotely.) Remote working can also enable new   productivity opportunities, especially for companies  with large field forces. One leading provider of  residential solar services recently documented  record sales using a more remote sales model.  In the next 90 days. During the first sprint, identify  the business areas where digital-execution  velocity is needed and map out plans for digital  factories to support them. In parallel, assess where  remote work models could unleash productivity  benefits. These two lenses should set the table  for targeted changes to the operating model. In  the second 30-day sprint, design the new models  with consideration for staffing level, expertise mix,  governance, and operating procedures. Finally, in  the third month, implement and operationalize the  new designs. We know from experience that three  months is sufficient to implement and scale a digital  factory. We have also seen banks, pharmaceutical  companies, and insurance companies pivot entire  field forces to a remote model in a few weeks.   Leaders who want to succeed in the digital-led  recovery must quickly reset their digital agendas to  meet new customer needs, shore up their decision- support systems, and tune their organizational  models and tech stacks to operate at the highest  effective speed. In other words, C-level executives  must point their digital firepower at the right targets  and quickly execute against them. It’s essential  to set these targets at the outset and regularly  measure progress against them. Achieving parity  or better across digital channels to win the revenue  race, rebuilding the most critical decision-support  models, and doubling development velocity are  goals that are all within reach. The 90-day plan will  help organizations get there.

But as the quote above  suggests, technology leaders are now starting  to think about how to get past the first wave of   crisis management.  This humanitarian crisis is still unfolding:  quarantines, lockdowns, and harrowing images  of hospitals straining under the weight of sick  patients all underscore the devastating human  effects of the pandemic. The economic picture  for many countries is dire. As we wrote recently,  COVID-19 is a crisis that requires companies to  address lives and livelihoods. CIOs have a critical  role to play because physical distancing and the  lockdown of economies require technology not  GES 2020 just to maintain business activities but also to  CIO lead businesses.  Exhibit 1 of 2 CIOs must still focus on emergency measures  and navigating through the chaos of the first   wave of this crisis. But the economic implications  require CIOs to start thinking ahead as well and  to position their organizations and businesses to  weather the downturn.  CIOs are already balancing important priorities  across horizons. Polls we conducted during two  recent webinars with more than 150 IT leaders  highlighted their top concerns: putting in place  collaboration tools and operating norms for working  from home at scale, a near-term priority, and the  increased strain on financials, a medium- and  longer-term consideration (Exhibit 1).  Given the gloomy economic outlook, CIOs may  be tempted to take a radical slash-and-burn  approach in an attempt to shore up IT. That would  be a mistake. While containing costs must be a  crucial element of the second-wave response,  CIOs have an opportunity to accelerate programs  and push priorities that can help position the  business to succeed when the downturn ends.  There’s no point in winning the battle but losing  the war.

These moves will require a corresponding  reprioritization of the project portfolio.  Stabilize emergency measures  We expect that the emergency measures taken as  an immediate response to the COVID-19 lockdown  will be sustained as long as the crisis continues.  CIOs should prioritize four areas on this front.  Strengthen remote-working capabilities Companies moved at mind-boggling speed to  GES 2020 support remote work. It’s now important to revisit  CIO those emergency measures to understand what  Exhibit 2 of 2 must be updated, changed, or replaced to deal with  issues that continue to hurt productivity.   First, organizations must review their ad hoc    vendor-selection procedures in light of the  alternatives in the market, increase network  capacity, implement scalable support processes,  and tighten controls that can secure and deploy  temporary solutions at scale.  Second, CIOs will need to address the needs of  special user groups, such as contact centers, users  of critical systems, and employees of finance  functions, to ensure that they can continue to  operate in an effective way remotely. For contact  centers, this may mean changing the routing of  calls to a dedicated COVID-19 subteam to adjust  for changes in questions from customers. Users of  critical systems may need to build up redundancy in  their remote-working setups. One energy company  can now run an entire trading floor from the homes  of employees, though with limited access to  information and slower decision support.  Finally, hardware supply-chain interruptions have  already proved to be a significant challenge as  peaks in short-term demand for devices and IT  hardware confront a breakdown of international  logistics. It might be an option, if not a necessity,   Exhibit 2 Chief information o(cid:19)cers in the next phase will need to take swift actions  along three dimensions. 9 actions to weather the crisis  Stabilize emergency measures  A.

Improve cybersecurity  In general, social engineering and insufficient  security measures for remote work are the two  main cybersecurity risks that organizations face  during this time of crisis.  In recent weeks, we have seen an increase  in COVID-19–focused social-engineering  cyberattacks, which have exploited the current  confusion and decreased the effectiveness of  the “human firewall” (for instance, the verification  of uncertainties with colleagues sitting nearby).  CIOs, working with their chief information-security  officers, must shore up their cyber protocols to deal  with compromised credentials and data, as well as  intellectual-property theft, fraud, and other crimes.  To address these problems, technology leaders  should continue to focus on people-based  initiatives that heighten the awareness of risk.  The initiatives may include placing messages on  lock screens or pop-up windows and creating  secure, dedicated, quick, and effective two-way  communication channels to the security team.  To support these solutions, organizations need  to beef up key processes, such as IT capacity to  help employees install and set up security tools,  not to mention implementing at scale security  technologies such as multifactor authentication- and-control mechanisms that provide remote  access to on-premise applications (for instance,  teller interfaces).  Adopt new best practices for agile ways  of working Co-location is an important factor for agile  ways of working to be productive. Remote work  obviously introduces real challenges, such as  disrupting a team’s continuous alignment, limiting  interactions, and complicating agile ceremonies— all of which threaten to drive productivity down.  Furthermore, remote environments amplify any  previous lack of clarity in roles, responsibilities,  and objectives.  Yet there are some companies that have  transitioned their digital units almost seamlessly  to remote settings, where individual team  members feel that they are working more  productively than before. One tech company,  for example, has fostered an outcome-driven  culture that empowers teams to undertake their  work outside traditional working hours. In weekly  review meetings, they are still held accountable  for getting things done.   When we looked more closely at companies that  have moved beyond shifting employees to work  from home during the first wave of the crisis, we  found four differentiating factors: they changed  the structure of teams to create smaller agile ones  of around five people, strengthened direction  setting through leadership, emphasized cultural  elements and delegated decisions, with clear  accountability, to individual team members, and  expanded the use of technology that promotes  effective collaboration.  Prepare for a potential breakdown of parts of  vendor ecosystems IT-outsourcing and offshoring vendors, as well as  shared-service centers, may well shut down at times.   30  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   To address that risk, CIOs are strongly advised to  make their vendor dependencies and individual  situations transparent—both their location and  the fallback options. Mitigation efforts should be  prepared not only with existing vendors but also  with alternative sources in different regions. A  McKinsey survey found that some global capability  centers already launching mitigation measures  report that “full” (more than 80 percent) production  capacity can be maintained for an average of 40  days during the crisis.  Scale down in the interim Meanwhile, CIOs must address the immediate  pressures on IT costs and creatively redeploy the   IT workforce.  Address immediate IT cost pressures With revenues and margins for many businesses  plummeting during the crisis, cost pressures on  IT will increase. In addition, emergency decisions  to manage the initial crisis response might have  increased costs—both operational and capital  expenditures. Technology and IT departments  will be asked to find short-term cost-reduction  opportunities to mitigate those effects. CIOs should  therefore consider some guiding principles:    — Be aggressive in IT cost reductions not only to  free up capital but also to invest in capabilities  for the “new normal” (more remote work, more  online interaction, and more automation). We  have found that IT costs can typically be reduced  by up to 30 percent quickly.   — Fully exploit areas of flexibility to address cost   pressures quickly before cutting into capabilities  that might affect the future business. In practice,  this means deferring nonessential projects  and investments that can be reversed, before  considering more permanent and potentially  damaging changes.   measures affect business operations and align  on them with stakeholders.  Creatively redeploy the IT workforce Disruptive changes in customer behavior and  emergency responses have dramatically shifted  workloads within organizations. Many on-site  operations have been drastically reduced and  long-term software-transformation efforts paused,  but call centers and online channels still must be  scaled up rapidly to meet demand. These realities  must guide CIOs when they redeploy their people— which includes reevaluating the role of outsourcing  partners. Other examples include back-filling for  colleagues most affected by the crisis (for instance,  those who must take care of small children or  affected family members) and filling roles left open  by external workers affected by the crisis.   In the past week, we have also seen many highly  inspiring examples of companies repurposing  their capabilities to help society cope with the  crisis. Tech companies have partnered with the  World Health Organization, pooling tech talent to  work on projects tackling challenges caused by  COVID-19. Another recent example: SAP set up a  team of 40 developers and created an emergency  web application in 24 hours for the German  Federal Foreign Office to manage the repatriation  of citizens abroad after the legacy system   became overloaded.   We believe this kind of thoughtful and creative  redeployment helps organizations cope with the  crisis, strengthens the sense of contribution and  purpose among employees, and keeps them  engaged during a period of remote work.  Pivot to new areas of focus Looking ahead, CIOs must also bolster the online  channels of their organizations and support new  interactions and services for customers.   — Quickly build a task force to establish the   baseline and full potential of cost-reduction  measures that then can be deployed in line with  the developing business situation. Additionally,  define thresholds when cost-reduction   Bolster online channels With people forced to work at home and to minimize  visits to brick-and-mortar stores, online sales and  service channels are experiencing a massive spike  in traffic—in China, we have recently seen increases   After the first wave: How CIOs can weather the coronavirus crisis  31   of 200 to 300 percent. In the medium term, the  traffic baseline for online behavior will probably  rise as a result. For now, organizations must act to  optimize and bolster their existing online channels to  improve customer interactions and solidify retention.  The management of traffic spikes is the most  pressing matter for online channels. Mildly invasive  short-term measures might include expanding  hardware capacity, decreasing or redistributing  loads (for instance, by running promotions during  off-peak hours), technical optimization (such as  horizontally scaling the caching layer), or rerouting  of traffic to scalable cloud solutions.  Support new interactions and services   for customers Some companies have responded quickly to the  new digital customer behavior by establishing new  products, such as mortgage deferrals and crisis- related insurance, or shifting customer interactions  to online channels. A government in Western  Europe, for example, embarked on an “express  digitization” of quarantine-compensation claims to  deal with a more than 100-fold increase in volume.  Sometimes this effort is about taking loads from  call centers, but more often it addresses real new  business opportunities. To engage with consumers,  for example, retailers in China increasingly gave  products at-home themes in WeChat.   Technology departments must anticipate and  prepare to offer more of these kinds of digital  services, products, and channels. The key to  reaching customers will be creating suitable access  interfaces between internal IT systems and external  social platforms and accelerating the integration of  new vendors and distributors.  Portfolio prioritization Given the enormous pressures CIOs are facing,  the entire project portfolio must come under  scrutiny to measure the tangible impact it can  deliver and how it fits in with the new priorities.  One CIO, for example, said that he has already  committed himself to continuing only projects  that are already nearly complete, reshaping or  reducing in scope other projects, and applying a  much more rigorous process to the selection and  advancement of projects.  We believe that CIOs should apply a crisis checklist  to review portfolio projects systematically against  key criteria, including these: “Are we still able to  deliver, either internally or with potentially affected  vendors?” “In what way does the project address  new business priorities?” “Does the project assume  functioning supply chains?”  With a clear crisis checklist in place, CIOs and  their teams can objectively continue, stop, defer,  or ramp down projects to maintain focus on what  really matters. As the crisis continues to unfold  and CIOs develop greater clarity about what the  next normal will look like, they will need to adjust  their criteria.  CIOs are already under a lot of pressure. After the  first shock and successful response, however, CIOs  must now handle multiple planning horizons in  parallel to manage the current crisis, prepare for the  downturn, and ultimately position the business for  success when the recovery comes.

We integrate deep expertise and  thought leadership from the best of McKinsey’s  experience in this unprecedented COVID-19  crisis to explore how data leaders can act across  three horizons to shape the way forward: ensure  data teams—and the whole organization—remain  operational, lead solutions to crisis-related  challenges to come, and adapt to the next normal.  As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the  globe, so too does its extraordinary impact on  nearly every country, business, and individual. Each  day, the world wakes up to rising case counts and  reports of unprecedented government efforts  to both keep citizens safe and stem economic  impacts—efforts that rely on access to trusted,  quality data.   Industries at the forefront of the crisis are also  relying on data in innumerable ways to inform their  response to the crisis. Healthcare providers, for  instance, are leveraging data from countries that  were affected earlier by COVID-19 to forecast needs  for hospital beds, masks, and ventilators. Grocery  chains are using sales data to help distributors  identify and ship the items most important to their  customers. Meanwhile, the sectors we rely on to  keep the wheels of the economy moving are using  data to inform their operations. Telecom players,  for example, are using network traffic data to  decide where to upgrade capacity in response to  the tremendous demand for bandwidth from an  increasingly remote workforce.  Chief data officers (CDOs) in every industry will play  a critical role in crisis response and the next normal  that follows. In today’s high-stakes environment,  where misinformation proliferates and organizations  must make decisions at a rapid pace, there’s  arguably never been such an imperative for CDOs to  provide organizations with timely and accurate data.   Senior executives will need ready access to both  new and newly critical data to make unprecedented   decisions in the short term and inform  adjustments to their business strategies and  operational plans in the medium to long term.  Banks, for example, will need to rethink credit  models. Manufacturers will need to reconfigure  supply chains. CDOs must not only lead the  way in sourcing, storing, and serving up the  necessary data but also work alongside business  and functional heads to identify and drive these  new priorities. All the while, they’ll tackle other  mission-critical responsibilities such as enabling  rapid reporting, mitigating new data-related  risks, and helping their organizations shift to a  predominantly digital operating model.   In this article, we highlight three waves of actions  CDOs should consider to help their organizations  navigate the crisis and the uncertain landscape  that lies ahead:   — ensure data teams—and the whole  organization—remain operational    — lead solutions to crisis-triggered challenges   to come   — prepare for the next normal (and execute   soon)  These insights are based on our discussions with  data leaders across industries over the past few  weeks and our experience from previous crises,  both financial and health related.  Ensure data teams—and the whole  organization—remain operational  The priority for CDOs is to take steps to protect  employees and help keep the organization up  and running, safeguarding data as companies  move fast to respond to the crisis.  Enable business continuity. Many institutions  have data technology or operations in multiple  locations, including offshore, which must remain  closed or operate with skeletal capacity. CDOs  must continue to provide for the health and  safety of their team members and colleagues   34  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   first and foremost. As the situation develops and  shifts, data leaders should continue to revisit the  business-continuity plans for their data operations  to ensure that there is adequate support on core  data platforms, identifying key personnel and  obtaining the required government waivers for  maintaining the critical infrastructure.  Set up a dedicated COVID-19 data nerve center.  The COVID-19 data nerve-center team should  include report owners, data stewards, data  engineers, data scientists, and data-visualization  specialists. This group should be tightly integrated  with the enterprise-wide COVID-19 response team  that is likely already in place and drive data efforts  that address the broader team’s needs as well as  those of other leaders, such as rapid development of  executive dashboards and daily reports on company  performance. In response to these urgent requests,  we’re seeing companies quickly adopt tools such as  robotic process automation to ingest and process  data much more rapidly than they could in the past.   Ensure data protection and privacy. Organizations  are being forced to operate in ways they have never  had to consider, such as having a large portion of  their staff working remotely for extended periods  of time. As organizations rapidly adapt to these  changing needs, they are exposing their data  assets to a variety of new attack vectors as well as  increasingly aggressive versions of existing foes  (bad actors that deploy ransomware, for example,  know hospitals do not have time for lengthy  negotiations). There are also rising data-security  concerns around providing riskier employees with  remote access to personally identifiable information  (PII), since traditional data controls may not work.  CDOs need to work with their information-security  peers to update the controls in place, particularly  on their key data assets by, for example, limiting  the ability to export data. CDOs could also update  policies to incorporate the remote-worker role with  limited permissions, for example, to take and print  screenshots or use external storage devices.  Lead solutions to crisis-triggered  challenges to come Organizations will face a vast number of challenges  in the coming months as they adjust to new ways   of working and serving customers, and potentially  confront additional waves of the virus’s spread.  CDOs can help in several areas.  Plan for likely stress scenarios. During the 2008  financial crisis, banks struggled to aggregate the data  needed to prepare reports for mitigating risk. Since  then, many banks have invested in these capabilities— driven in part by the regulatory push of the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision regulation 239  (BCBS 239) principles—an investment that’s paying  dividends in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. CDOs  in other industries should adopt similar practices in  an effort that supports their company’s plan-ahead  team. The effort should begin with identifying the  probable stress scenarios—such as another rapid  increase in the infection rate, geopolitical events, or  bankruptcies—defining the types of reports required  to monitor each of them and surfacing the data  needed to build them. They will also need to adjust  data processes to adapt to the typical challenges  observed during times of stress—for example,  “shutting off” or at least limiting nonmaterial data  streams to reduce the load in an environment where  key employees might be absent or redeployed on  crisis-related projects.   Proactively tap new data sources. During this  time, the CDO should become the go-to person for  all data needed across the organization—not just  existing sources, but also new and alternative ones,  such as video, audio, and geospatial. Some retailers,  for example, are using state-level   COVID-19 trends to manage inventory, categorizing  their merchandise into two buckets: essential or  nice to have. To guide their data sourcing, CDOs  should proactively engage business leaders now to  understand the challenges likely to arise throughout  the phases of the crisis and its aftermath so that  the data is on hand when it’s needed. In addition  to helping to identify and provide data, we see  CDOs in some industries supporting the execution  of analytics use cases such as store-closure  prediction, sentiment analysis, or supply simulation.  Forward thinkers are proactively setting up data  labs to identify indicators of economic recovery  from customer, supplier, and vendor signals.  Contribute to data ecosystems for public good.  Evaluate opportunities to exchange data (including   How chief data officers can navigate the COVID-19 response and beyond  35   that which may not have been deemed useful earlier)  with peers at adjacent companies, government  agencies, and nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs) to help solve societal problems related to  the current crisis. An alliance of researchers and  technology leaders recently launched the COVID- 19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and were  supported by the White House in issuing a call  to action to develop new text- and data-mining  capabilities to help answer questions about the  disease. The European Commission is convening  a group of leading telecoms in Europe to leverage  anonymized cell-tower data to enable cross-country  relief efforts for impacted regions. Participating  in data ecosystems will not only help citizens but  also help organizations develop the ecosystem- building capabilities and partnerships they’ll need  to compete going forward as industry boundaries  continue to blur.   Prepare to reduce cost surgically. Take a  “reprioritize and invest” approach to the current  portfolio of data initiatives rather than a “slash  and hold” approach. Organizations that radically  reduced their portfolios during previous crises  came out on the other side of them markedly less  prepared than those that did not. In the automotive  industry, for instance, investing in digital sales  channels is critical for success in the long run (and  also helps in the nearer term by bypassing complex  dealer structures affected by COVID-19). Cost  reduction is an important priority, but adapting the  business model through data and analytics in the  longer term is as well.   Prepare for the next normal (and  execute soon)  CDOs should begin planning and executing  initiatives that allow their firms to emerge from  the crisis with better data capabilities and  organizational resiliency.  Leverage momentum to invest in the future.  Chances are that CDOs will build out new  capabilities or showcase the value of existing  ones as they contribute to the crisis response.  Some of these could serve as the building blocks  for long-deferred initiatives, such as developing  a 360-degree view of the customer, adopting   consistent tool sets and processes, or modernizing  their data architecture and moving to the cloud.  They can also serve as a catalyst to recommit to—or  perhaps even set bolder—organizational aspirations  to become data driven. Businesses are likely  getting even more practice using data as they make  decisions on the back of crisis-related data. Build on  these efforts by setting stretch goals such as having  all meetings and key decisions backed by data.  While implementation of these initiatives will require  time, they have the potential to shore up the health  of the organization and prepare it for the future.   Review and revamp offerings. The crisis will force  CDOs to review their offerings based on new needs  arising from the next normal, which is likely to be  more digitized than ever before. Risk reports and  other business intelligence will likely change along  with the data that populate them. Data and models  for churn or attrition, workforce management,  relationship deepening, digital marketing, and  supply-chain and market analytics will all need to be  refreshed. This will be an intensive and significant  undertaking for the entire organization, requiring  visionary and communicative CDO leadership.  Hire and retain top talent. Good data employees can  be hard to replace, so finding ways to protect them  should be a top priority for the CDO. Additionally, as  smaller organizations and start-ups face financial  instability through the crisis, top data talent may be  looking for work. Make it a priority to hire this talent  for the betterment of society, the economy, and your  team. Some companies have already taken measures  to establish themselves as a “safe-harbor brand” on  the talent market and are bringing in top talent who  were previously not interested in joining. They are  using this momentum to transform their culture and  ensure that top-tier talent remains onboard.   Build resiliency for future crises. Invest in additional  capabilities that will allow the organization to create  more flexibility and timeliness in data aggregation  and reporting. One example would be to proactively  conduct “drills” to simulate a scenario and produce  and discuss ad hoc reports. By strengthening this  muscle, we expect that organizations will be much  better prepared for any subsequent outbreaks  or other crises—which are likely throughout the  coming decades.  36  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   CDOs should proactively engage business   leaders now to understand the challenges   likely to arise throughout the phases   of the crisis and its aftermath so that the  data is on hand when it’s needed.   Rethink and digitize physical processes and  footprints. Many organizations will need to rapidly  reinvent processes that previously required physical  documents, to become paperless. Enabling the  submission of scanned copies for document  verification and supporting contactless servicing  capabilities (for example, by creating digital forms  to replace physical forms and enabling electronic- signature capture) will likely be key priorities.  Organizations finding rapid success in these areas  are adapting solutions that are already used by other  business units or for other products. Any entirely  new processes that are developed will require ample  time for testing.  For sectors with a significant physical footprint,  such as brick-and-mortar retail, CDOs should lead  the way in enabling key decisions—for example, by  crossing geospatial data for their stores with data  on propagation of the virus to help leaders decide  on physical-store closures and where to employ  augmented-staffing models.  Reinforce the ethical use of data. As organizations  make these new pushes, it will be important for   CDOs to drive home the tenets of data governance  and ethical data usage to all data citizens across  the company. Although crises often require rapid  action, the cornerstones of any data initiative should  continue to be data risk, privacy rights, and ethics.  While the crisis lasts, CDOs might have to employ  quick-hit tactics, such as defining and circulating  ethical data-usage principles and educating teams  new to using data on the fly. Leveraging programs  such as data and analytics academies and making  significant use of online learning can make this type of  important education ongoing and give it greater depth.  This is a difficult time for everyone—corporations,  governments, customers, and employees. While  CDOs’ near-term focus should overwhelmingly be  the health and safety of employees and enabling  crisis response, as the situation stabilizes, they must  step up and make a big contribution to the long- term viability of their organization by empowering it  to make effective data-driven decisions.

Emerging evidence points to  a significant shift, as customers scale back their  shopping in stores and instead go online.   In China, online shopping has increased 15 to   20 percentage points,1 and e-commerce in Italy  has increased 81 percent compared with the last  week of February.2 US consumers have largely  followed the same pattern. The COVID-19 crisis  is first and foremost a human tragedy, requiring  companies to take immediate steps to protect their  people. Amid this human cost, companies are also  starting to come to terms with the impact of the  crisis on their businesses. With offline shopping  collapsing, companies’ strategies will need to focus  on fortifying their web presence and, in some cases,  building an online business.   We have found that companies can create a  working e-commerce site in much less time than  they think. In fact, a poor understanding of what’s  really possible with digital can be one of the most  significant hinderances to moving quickly. As we  highlight in Fast Times: How Digital Winners Set  Direction, Learn, and Adapt (Amazon Publishing,  February 2020), low aspirations lead to modest,  even negligible, outcomes. In our experience,  completely new businesses can be launched in  fewer than four months. Normally, a company  requires at least six to nine months to get a complete  solution up and running (and often considerably  longer when outsourcing the work to multiple  vendors and agencies, with the increased need for  coordination slowing down cycle times).  We had the opportunity to watch this thesis play  out in the real world recently at one European retail  chain that has around 1,000 brick-and-mortar  stores across the world. The chain, owned by a  private-equity fund, had no e-commerce presence.  Although it had previously considered e-commerce,  there were serious concerns about whether it could   ever work, given the assortment, concept, and even  brand constraints. Despite these issues, a variety of  pressures, from consumer demand to competitive  constraints, forced the company to take action.  Thirteen weeks later, it had a functioning  e-commerce business in one of the regions it  operated in. Not only that, its launch was successful  from the first month, generating almost 3 percent  revenue growth within the chosen region, tripling  average basket size compared with retail stores,  and maintaining a high customer-satisfaction score.  When COVID-19 started disrupting daily routines  in Europe, the e-commerce revenues jumped up  threefold almost overnight.   This article describes the main lessons from   that program.   Be pragmatic Before work started on launching an e-commerce  business in our example, the company’s leadership  gathered to discuss the ambition for the endeavor.  One word dominated that discussion: “pragmatic.”  Rather than attempting to launch a full-blown digital  business across all markets at once, the CEO opted  to go to market fast with a limited offering and  in limited geographies, gain strong traction, and  then scale up and out aggressively (see sidebar,  “Supporting your remote teams”).  Within days, a new team created a comprehensive,  week-by-week plan that covered everything from  creating customer-testing touchpoints to setting  up the warehouse with electricity and equipment  to photographing and writing copy for every one  of the 800 products to go on offer. All nonrelevant  initiatives were postponed in favor of efforts that  had direct customer impact. The team closely  scrutinized every feature and ruthlessly prioritized  intermediate release goals for what mattered most.  This biweekly review exercise also made room for  fixing problems when things inevitably went wrong.  1 COVID-19 mobile survey, February 2020; n = 1,249 respondents across 46 Chinese cities. 2 Expert calls; Chiara Bertoletti, “#Coronavirus Nuovi dati sulle vendite della gdo in store e online,” Gdoweek, March 6, 2020, gdoweek.it.  Building an e-commerce business: Lessons on moving fast  41   Supporting your remote teams   As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, it  overtook the effort of a retail chain to   refine its new e-commerce site. The team,  like workers around the world, had to learn  quickly how to collaborate with one another  while working remotely. The lessons   from that experience and others include  the following:   — Invest in adoption and   standardization. It’s not enough to  have the best collaboration tools  available. The level of people’s  familiarity with collaboration tools   varies, so spend time up front in  training people how to use them  well. Also standardize which tools  to use. In an effort to move quickly,  people may just gravitate to what  they know best, resulting in the use  of incompatible tools.    — Invest in adequate tools and support—  for example, pay for upgraded Wi-Fi  and distribute 4G or 5G modems.    — Stay committed to what works.  Problem-solve the new issues—  foreseen and unforeseen—that  arise the way you do any other  challenge: uncover the problems  and innovate solutions by agile trial  and error. Maintain frequent check- ins and track progress.    — Understand that in a time of crisis,  team members have personal and  family responsibilities that they must  also handle. Have the empathy and  flexibility to enable that.  This lesson was repeated a second time when  management reevaluated scaling plans in light  of COVID-19. The team focused instead on  further strengthening the core functionality of  the e-commerce business and providing an easy,  dependable way for a locked-down population to  shop for what it needed.  Be clear with responsibilities: Assign  ownership, not tasks A crucial element in enabling speed during our  example retail chain’s launch of its e-commerce  business was clearly designating which teams were  responsible for which tasks—and then giving them  the space to complete their work. Management  created four teams with responsibility for specific  work streams and ownership over a certain portion  of the customer journey. Management then stepped  back, giving teams the responsibility and flexibility  to solve every unplanned issue that occurred there  and pushed them to be creative with solutions. The  four teams and their tasks were as follows:  with customers and building it iteratively. It  also had to develop tech capabilities for  connecting the back end of the store with the  warehouse-management system, inventory  synchronization, and order handling. The  team owned the customer journey from the  moment the customer arrived to when an order  landed on the handheld tablets carried by the  pickers in the warehouse. Over time, the tech  stack developed to a point at which almost all  content-level changes could be done without  developer involvement.   — The operations team was in charge of setting up   the warehouse: establishing packing stations  and picking trolleys, setting up the workforce for  the warehouse and customer support, liaising  with carriers and intermediaries to set up a new  relationship, and detailing the procedures for  handling all common and edge cases. It owned  the part of the journey that started when the  warehouse received an order and ended when  the customer received their package.   — The tech-and-design team was in charge  of defining the microservices architecture,  including codesigning the online-store concept    — The product-assortment team analyzed the  full product assortment available, chose the  800 best SKUs to launch with (based on   42  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Putting in place the right measures   and key performance indicators   early in the process of creating an   e-commerce business is as important   as launching quickly.  multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria— for example, “shippability” of items such as  ice cream and fragile glassware, sizing to  fit existing boxes, and logical fit with other  products in the assortment); obtained samples  to photograph, measure, and describe; and  created creative online-only bundles. It owned  the portion of the customer journey covering all  of the steps necessary for a customer to find,  understand, and choose a product. As such, the  team worked closely with the tech-and-design  team in the initial phases.    — The marketing team, which kicked off nine  weeks before the launch, created a detailed  marketing launch plan, set up a structured  customer-relationship-management system  and biweekly campaigns to increase the size  of the database by almost threefold prior to  launch, worked with an agency to come up  with a creative launch campaign, and planned  an operation in which all the content and  merchandise (such as posters, T-shirts, and  bags) would roll out in unison on launch day  across offline stores, social media, search  advertising, influencers, and various PR  channels. This team owned the customer  decision journey, from complete lack of  awareness to the moment a customer landed  on the home page for the first time.  At the end of each day, all the teams came together  for an all-hands checkout to update each other  about the newest developments. This habit—along   with solid agile ceremonies, such as weekly sprint  planning, biweekly demonstrations, retrospectives,  and use of collaboration tools (Kanban boards and  Slack)—was the perfect counterweight to work- stream independence and ensured that everyone  was in sync at all times.  Learn and adapt Putting in place the right measures and key  performance indicators early in the process of  creating an e-commerce business is as important as  launching quickly. It allows companies to track the  progress that matters so that they can learn, adapt,  and drive continual improvement. It is not enough  to measure overall conversion or conversion by  channel. Instead, companies need more granular  metrics—for example, to identify relevant customer  cohorts, measure microconversions per cohort, and  then improve for that use case continually. Metrics  or key performance indicators that are too high level  don’t provide a clear-enough story. This concept,  in particular, is crucial because launching an  e-commerce presence is not a discrete project but  much more a program of continual improvement.  In our retailer example, the leadership decided early  on that the goal of the e-commerce initiative was to  launch quickly a business that could gain traction  within a single region and then to use it to learn and  improve before going all out globally. The company  knew that it needed first to build a muscle to operate  and optimize a multinational digital business—and that  the best way to do that was by learning through doing.  Building an e-commerce business: Lessons on moving fast  43   After a successful launch, for example, the  team spent a month analyzing pain points and  bottlenecks and then experimenting with new  solutions to improving the experience continually. It  was able to act quickly because it had established  a simple spreadsheet model to track progress. The  team checked it daily the first two weeks and weekly  thereafter. It then added new metrics as goals  changed. For example, when focusing on growing  B2B segments, it tracked the number of orders and  revenue for B2B customers daily. When focusing  on improving operations, it tracked pick-and-pack  speed and the percentage of fulfilled orders per day.   occasions, such as birthdays— that tested very well  with customers prelaunch but simply didn’t perform  in reality.   By keeping a weekly sprint rhythm, it was possible   to pivot away from poor ideas and generate new ones  constantly until the team found ones that worked.  Week by week, the improvements and lessons  accumulated, and by month three, the e-commerce  business had matured into a state at which a good  sales day wasn’t a victory but business as usual.  The team also developed prototypes for various new  features to test with customers and abandoned many  pet ideas that simply didn’t stick. The team had to  go back on one of the online-exclusive ideas—staff  curated bundles of products based on common   Building an e-commerce business from scratch is  no small undertaking. But experience has shown  that a dedicated program properly structured can  not only pull it off but do it far faster than many  might think is possible.

As organizations and leaders seek to   ensure the health and safety of their people, they  are also reacting to supply-chain shifts that are  impacting sourcing and distribution logistics.  Supplier resilience is being brought into sharp  focus, and labor shortages are bringing many  production lines to a halt.  However, the crisis will eventually resolve, at which  point production facilities will need to move quickly  to respond to new sources of supply and shifting  customer demands. It is these types of pressures  that make digital capabilities so critical,  providing  flexibility and resilience manufacturers need   to mobilize and operate in unfamiliar territory.   Yet most companies that have attempted enterprise- wide “digital transformation” have failed to capture  the full business opportunities available from new  technologies. What lessons can manufacturers learn  from the few organizations that have succeeded in  moving from successful small pilot projects to scaling  digital innovations across their production networks?  Our latest research and experience have   allowed us to uncover new insights into the  challenges and success factors in implementing  digital manufacturing at scale. Moreover, our work  has also found that European manufacturing is  lagging behind the rest of the world. Only 17 of the  44 members of the Global Lighthouse Network¹  (manufacturers that have been recognized as leading  the way in their adoption of digital technologies) are  in Europe, and only three of these are using fourth  industrial revolution (4IR) tools across their end-to- end value chains.  Some of this seeming hesitation may be because  many European manufacturers operate on  brownfield sites. The task of enhancing legacy  processes, systems, and machinery with 4IR tools  can seem more daunting than building a digital  production facility from the ground up. However,   there is a risk that much of European manufacturing  may fall so far behind that they will prove unable to  recover the ground lost to more technologically- advanced manufacturers elsewhere.  The time for organizations to act and to implement  digital is now. Our research has revealed five  fundamental principles that translate into  tangible actions for scaling and sustaining digital  technologies, regardless of a manufacturer’s  starting point.  Industry 4.0 can unlock   significant value A select group of industry-leading manufacturers  are using digital transformation to develop new or  enhanced ways of operating their businesses, using  a variety of Industry 4.0 capabilities:   — Data, computational power, and connectivity,  such as sensors, the Internet of Things, cloud  technology, and blockchain   — Analytics and intelligence, ranging from big data  and  advanced analytics to  artificial intelligence  and knowledge-work automation   — Human-machine interaction, including virtual   and augmented reality, robotics and automation,  robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots   — Advanced production methods such as additive   manufacturing and use of renewable energy  The benefits these companies have recorded  include 30 to 50 percent reductions of machine  downtime, 15 to 30 percent  improvements in  labor productivity, 10  to 30 percent increases in  throughput, and 10 to 20 percent decreases in the  cost of quality. These breakthroughs create impact  across the value chain that may be even more  important, if harder to measure: increased flexibility  to meet customer demand, faster speed to market,  and better integration within the supply chain.  1  The Global Lighthouse Network is an ongoing research project of the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with McKinsey.  46  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Although all of the manufacturers we assessed are  transitioning to digital manufacturing, they are not  deploying these technologies at the same rate. In  fact, most organizations find themselves stuck in  “pilot purgatory,” with no clear approach for quickly  scaling up innovations across the manufacturing  network. Our latest research confirms that at least  70% of manufacturers are languishing in pilot  purgatory, according to the findings from the Global  Lighthouse Network.  Culture is generally considered to be among the  most significant challenges to scaling. Additionally,  companies’ path to success at scale is often hindered  by the absence of several fundamentals, including:   — Strategic direction regarding where and how  digital manufacturing will bring real business  value, as well as the incentives for people to  make it happen   — The required capabilities—technical,   managerial, and transformational—to truly  understand and execute the changes   — Robust data and IT infrastructure, which   instead are often patchy and become a  bottleneck for scaling successful pilots  A scaling approach based on five  principles  How can a manufacturer successfully scale digital  manufacturing across a global network and capture  its full potential? Our latest research and experience  show that a transformational approach should be  based on five fundamental principles (Exhibit 1).  Focus on business value  To succeed, the scaling of digital manufacturing  must originate from the company’s digital strategy,  with clear financial and operational-performance  aspirations. These aspirations must in turn become  formal targets linked to real business needs and  cascaded throughout the organization.    For example, at a global pharmaceutical company,  various business units had been experimenting  with digital innovations in their operations for   some time—but few ideas achieved much impact  beyond the individual unit. Company leaders  recognized that they needed to clarify on a  network-wide basis which digital solutions could  contribute to the entire enterprise’s business  needs and priorities—and, accordingly, where  to focus the transformation efforts and how to  implement at scale.

The effort helped the company  achieve four critical objectives:  the network. The plan integrated both digital and  traditional improvements, accounted for resources  and technology requirements, and reflected a clear  strategy for building capabilities at scale.   — Confirm where and how the value at stake  in digital manufacturing can support real  business needs   — Define a prioritized portfolio of digital solutions   to scale  Transform through an integrated approach To drive transformational change, a company must  follow an integrated approach at each of its sites.  The approach should address a comprehensive  set of capabilities and follow a structured process  (Exhibit 2):    — Understand the level of readiness of its data and    — Design digital solutions built upon a repository   technology infrastructure across the network   — Understand the investment required in   technical, managerial, and transformational  capabilities  The company applied the insights from the scan  to create an aligned, and value-oriented road map  for rolling out the digital transformation across   of value-driven use cases. Deploy the use cases  as “integrated bundles” to maximize return on  investment (ROI), and center them around user  journeys to enhance sustainability.   — Establish the data and technical architecture,  in close collaboration with the IT function, to  ensure scalable solutions for future roll-out.  For example, horizontal scalability enables   Exhibit 2 Digital transformation at a site should address a comprehensive set of  Digital transformation at a site should address a comprehensive set of  capabilities and follow a structured process. capabilities and follow a structured process.

For example, build  “minimum viable products” rapidly and iteratively  while keeping things simple and learning along  the way to make adjustments as needed.  Create capabilities for deployment A well-thought-through operating model provides  the basis for establishing the cross-functional  setups and new capabilities that ensure effective  deployment. To support both leadership and the  front line through implementation, the company  should build communities of practitioners  including  digital change agents, data scientists,  data engineers, and IT architects. The company  also needs “translators” to facilitate interactions  between technical experts and businesspeople.   To maximize value from the transformation, the  company should combine new and existing  capabilities (Exhibit 3). For example, a global medtech  company is using the new digital capabilities  to enhance its existing lean-management and  operational-excellence capabilities, rather than  replace them.  This combination’s power becomes clear in the  application of advanced analytics to improve  manufacturing-line performance. The technology  cannot deploy itself: An experienced process  engineer is needed, first to install sensors and  then to use them in improving the process. It’s the  engineer who develops a root-cause hypothesis  for subpar performance and identifies possible  countermeasures, working with a data scientist who  uses advanced analytics and modeling to prepare,   process, analyze, and interpret the data that the  sensors produce. In addition, a domain expert with  prior lean-management experience must serve as  a translator who facilitates the interface between  the line teams and the analytics and data experts.  The translator glues together the new and existing  capabilities, so that the team can interpret the  results and make changes on the shop floor.  Most members of the team leading the  transformation should be 100 percent dedicated   to the effort over a fixed time period, applying   a capability-building strategy that uses on-  and off-the-job training with rigorous talent  development. Organizations that have already  codified their best capability practices into an  existing manufacturing and supply chain academy  can provide training for the new roles and skillsets  that culminates in accreditation.  Scale deployment, capabilities, and  technology A company needs robust governance of innovation  to develop value-driven use cases across its network  on a continuous—preferably, industrialized—basis.  The successful structures typically depend on some  degree of centralization: an internal “lighthouse”  site that has successfully implemented multiple  4IR technologies, for example, or an “agile studio”  environment for experiencing agile working practices,  or an “innovation hub” for ideation of new ideas.  The insights these structures develop can then be  replicated quickly across the business.   The structures also impose order, such as by  categorizing use cases on the basis of maturity: in  development, ready for industrialization, or scalable.  It is important to have clear objectives and a set of  rules on how to drive the development and scaling  of the use cases, as well as promote positive  collaboration across the network. Some sites will  lead development, while others will industrialize use  cases to be deployed at scale in the remaining sites.  Preparing for the next normal via digital manufacturing’s scaling potential  49   To deploy the changes successfully, make structural investments into  Exhibit 3 To deploy the changes successfully, make structural investments into new capabilities. new capabilities.

For  example, a global company identified priority  use cases and was preparing to roll out digital  manufacturing across its network. It invested in a  joint effort by practitioners at selected sites and  its global center of excellence (CoE) to capture and  codify a use-case repository that included detailed  how-to guides and tactical training material. The   contents of the repository were made available for  redeployment throughout the network.  The scale-up across the network should  be formalized in a road map with adapted  deployment models that best fit the organization’s  context and needs, scaling mechanisms, and a  resourcing strategy. The sequence and timeline  of scaling should reflect the company’s priorities  with regard to which use cases to implement,   50  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   where to implement them, and when to initiate  implementation and scale up. The prioritization  should take into consideration business needs,  value at stake, potential ROI, and site readiness.  An organization can combine various roll-out  options and tailor them based on its situation and  maturity. These options include:   — A site-by-site rollout, with a dedicated team   supporting each site’s transformation and  capability building   — Using an “academy” to transform multiple  sites in parallel through structured on-the- ground capability building, with fieldwork to  accomplish concrete changes between the  training sessions   — A use-case propagation approach, in which   specific, well-scoped initiatives are developed  and rolled out across multiple sites, potentially  in an accelerated fashion as no-regrets moves   — A hybrid model in which certain use cases   have an accelerated roll out, while others are  deployed more gradually in the context of a  comprehensive site transformation  A digital CoE provides the required backbone for the  digital transformation at scale and for supporting  the sites. Early on, the company should clarify the  CoE’s overarching role at each stage of executing  the road map. For example, to define the best value  proposition for its CoE, a global company specified  the following roles and responsibilities:   — Developing and codifying digital solutions,    as well as new ways of operating in conjunction  with the sites   — Providing and building digital capabilities at the  site level and developing digital communities— for example, leveraging a “see, do, teach”  approach that includes capability accreditation   — Delivering on-the-ground support and   coaching for digital deployment to sites’   leaders, change teams, and front lines to help  them reach their targets; this includes, for  example, using common playbooks to support  change management, capability building,   and sustainability  Finally, another major enabler of deployment at  scale is ensuring the accessibility and scalability of  data within a flexible technology architecture. Most  companies will need to develop and transition to  a future-state data and technology architecture— including data capture, extraction, consolidation,  systems, tools, and site hardware. To develop  this  architecture, a company needs an integrated  view of the potential use cases and the required  data and technology. It must also take a longer- term perspective to sustain this new architecture  by anticipating potential future technology  development and disruptions. All of these elements  should be linked to a syndicated future-state data  and technology architecture design.  Establishing an architecture to meet   future needs To implement its use-case road map, a global  company designed a data and technology  architecture using a minimum viable architecture  (MVA) approach—including the required  technologies and tool stack down to site level.  The architecture anticipates the critical features  required to support the use-case road map, making  it easily extendable over time. It also systematically  standardizes practices for extracting data from  legacy systems, with the potential to automate  data-quality validations and highlight gaps  between the actual and required data quality early  on. Additionally, the architecture enables future  scaling by re-using data engineering and analytics  components through a repository of codes, data  pipelines, and apps.  In many situations, external vendors will play a  prominent role in deploying technology at scale.   Preparing for the next normal via digital manufacturing’s scaling potential  51   A company must take a thorough approach to  engaging with vendors, including during the selection,  assessment, and feasibility studies, as well as the  day-to-day development and collaboration phases.  To maintain transparency and proper governance  for important decisions and interactions, a company  needs to deploy a streamlined and consolidated  approach to vendor management.  Manage for impact Starting from day one, a company must ensure that  it captures the operational and financial benefits  to enable a self-funding digital transformation at  scale. To manage for impact, a company needs  strong governance of performance and health. This  includes assigning clear ownership, responsibility,  and accountability within the business units and  among the P&L owners—not within the CoE.   By rigorously managing the delivery of impact, a  company can reach the hard-to-achieve targets.  Sustaining the impact requires managing the  health of the transformation with respect to the  various requirements we have discussed—such  as scoping, resources and capabilities, change  story and communication, leadership commitment,  and transitioning to the future-state data and  technology architecture.  To work in an agile and iterative way, teams must  adhere to strict governance. This includes starting  sprints with the top deliverables identified, and  having daily check-ins to align on priorities and  actions for the day. At the end of a sprint, teams  should review progress and address roadblocks,  as well as consider how well the team collaborated  and the opportunities for improvement. Strong  governance also includes regular steering  committee meetings to review achievements and  critical risks.  Among the best practices we have observed is using  a playbook to codify the approach to scaling and  sustaining the transformation. The playbook could  include a how-to guide structured in phases and  specifying activities and deliverables, as well as  use-case guides for each digital solution, detailed  with all supporting elements.  Finally, as with any at-scale transformation, it is  crucial to remember that change management is an  integral part of the effort. Implementing technology  solutions alone will not elevate performance!  Summing up: Best practices derived  from our research and experience Exhibit 4 summarizes the key elements of the  scaling approach and highlights best practices  relating to each.   — Development, industrialization, and rollout   usually start with a lighthouse (or set of  lighthouses) to enable the development  and industrialization of use cases. This also  allows the organization to crack data-access  challenges and begin to shape the technology  architecture. The learnings are captured in  a library of approved apps and playbooks  that support the transformation, as well as  in building the blueprint for the data and  technology architecture needed in scale up.   — Enablement and governance are supported  by a digital CoE that covers elements needed  for sustainability, capability building and  resourcing, and change management. The  CoE is typically also a supporting mechanism  for continuous codification and transfer  of knowledge, data and IT-architecture  requirements, use cases, and code when the  transformation is eventually scaled up across  a network.   — Scale-up is based on business needs and  the value at stake, with prioritization made  transparent on a well-defined road map. In  scaling up, the company selects the most  appropriate deployment models, whether  site by site or use case (or a combination). It  supports the efforts with playbooks and a “see,  do, teach” approach to build capabilities and  skills. As scale-up progresses, the learnings are  continually codified back into the app library  and playbooks and inform data and technology  architecture needs.  52  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit 4 The scaling approach covers rollout, governance, and value capture.

What   mitigation actions are you working on?   — How are you balancing the need for tangible   change with the imperative for a quick return on  investment?   — To what extent are you combining   transformations of your business, technology,  and organizational capabilities?  For many manufacturers, the answers to these  questions will point to the need for a thorough  reconsideration of their approach to digital  transformation. Those that act quickly to orchestrate  and sustain a digital transformation will be better  placed to respond to the long-lasting changes in the  operating environment resulting from the coronavirus  pandemic. Moreover, the flexibility and resilience  that digital will add to operations as manufacturing  ramps up again once the current crisis is over, will  allow those organizations that transform successfully  to gain a significant advantage over slower-moving  competitors. Now is the time to get started.  How should European manufacturing leaders  prepare to transform at scale? To assess a company’s readiness to orchestrate a  digital manufacturing transformation that integrates  the five fundamental principles, leaders of  manufacturing organizations should consider   the following questions:   — Where would digital, robotics, and advanced   analytics create the most value in your  manufacturing network?   — What is your current ambition level for a    digital transformation? What impact do you  aspire to in the short term and medium   term, respectively?   — How have you connected your digital strategy   to your existing operations strategy?   — How advanced is your organization in its   journey from digital development and piloting to  at-scale deployment?   — Have you already established a lighthouse,  agile studio, or innovation hub within your  organization to support robust governance?   — What successes have you achieved? Which   factors have been critical to success?

Much will depend on  their digital and analytics capabilities.    by Antonio Gonzalo, Holger Harreis, Carlos Sanchez Altable, and Cyrielle Villepelet  55   The COVID-19 pandemic is simultaneously an  unprecedented health crisis and a global economic  shock. Amid the pandemic, the apparel, fashion,  and luxury (AF&L) industry has moved quickly to  address urgent public-health needs—closing stores,  manufacturing much-needed items such as face  masks and hand sanitizer, and making donations  to healthcare and community organizations. At  the same time, AF&L companies are grappling  with COVID-19’s business ramifications, including  widespread job losses in an industry that provides  livelihoods for millions of people worldwide.   Although no one in the industry foresaw the intensity  of this crisis, some fashion companies are finding  that they are better equipped than others—largely  because of their digital know-how. In this article,   we touch on COVID-19’s impact on the AF&L  industry to date. We then propose a set of actions  that AF&L companies can take to build their digital  and analytics capabilities—not just to ensure  business continuity and minimize the downside of  COVID-19, but also to emerge from the crisis in a  position of strength.   A deepening digital divide Our consumer-sentiment surveys, conducted in  April, show declines in purchase intent of 70 to   80 percent in offline and 30 to 40 percent in online  in Europe and North America, even in countries that  haven’t been under full lockdown.1 E-commerce is  clearly not offsetting the sales declines in stores.  Nevertheless, it has been a lifeline for fashion  brands as stores have been shuttered—and it will  continue to be critical during and after the recovery  period. In China, the return of offline traffic has been  gradual, with 74 percent of Chinese consumers  saying they avoided shopping malls in the two  weeks after stores reopened.2 This suggests that  some percentage of offline sales could permanently  migrate to e-commerce.   Digital is not only an increasingly important  sales channel; it can also help companies adapt   cost structures and make each step of the value  chain better, faster, and cheaper. For example,  digitization can enable new logistics and sales- fulfillment options (such as click-and-collect and  drive-through), fuel innovative ways of customer  acquisition, and help predict and manage inventory  to create a more resilient supply chain. The  fundamental enabler to all this will be data—the  transparency, governance, and accuracy of which  have never been more important.  This all portends a deepening digital divide. Even  before the crisis, companies that were digitally and  analytically mature outperformed competitors that  hadn’t built robust digital and analytics capabilities  (Exhibit 1). The COVID-19 crisis has only widened  the gap between industry leaders and laggards. For  leaders with the ability and willingness to invest,  the pandemic has clearly been an accelerator. As  a top executive of a leading apparel player recently  declared, “We’ve accomplished two years of digital  transformation in two months.”  Thus, for executives in the AF&L sector and all related  subsectors (such as beauty products and sporting  goods), the imperative is clear: make digital and  analytics a core element of your company’s strategy.  A number of trends in the post-COVID-19 world—the  “next normal”—could make digital and analytics play  an even more important role.3 Physical distancing  could continue, making consumers less likely to  visit brick-and-mortar stores, and a contact-free  economy could emerge—raising e-commerce and  automation to a new level.   The implications of these trends will differ for each  company, depending on its digital starting point  and strategic orientation. Digital and analytics  leaders (companies in which online sales account  for 30 to 40 percent of total sales, parts of the  value chain are significantly digitized, and online  and offline channels are integrated to some degree)  have an advantage today but could quickly lose  it if other players accelerate their transformation.   1 For survey findings by country, see “Global surveys of consumer sentiment during the coronavirus crisis,” April 2020, McKinsey.com. 2 McKinsey Chinese COVID-19 consumer-sentiment survey with field work March 21–23, 2020. 3 Shubham Singhal and Kevin Sneader, “The future is not what it used to be: Thoughts on the shape of the next normal,” April 2020,    McKinsey.com.  56  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   COVID Fashion Digital Exhibit 1 of 6  Exhibit 1 Digital and analytics leaders outperform their competitors in total returns to  shareholders.

That said, digitization won’t be a panacea.  Companies should direct investments to areas  in which the highest business value lies—which  might not be in sales but rather elsewhere in the  value chain. Equally important, companies should  avoid “gold plating,” aiming instead for the fastest  minimum viable digital solution that will achieve the  business goal. Finally, the sequencing of initiatives  will play a big role in making a company’s digital  transformation as self-funding as possible.   Navigate the now: Immediate priorities  The health and safety of employees and customers,  of course, has been—and remains—the absolute  priority. By now, AF&L companies have closed stores,  introduced new hygiene and safety processes in  warehouses and distribution centers, and set up  digital tools for remote working and collaboration.   Although the situation remains uncertain and is  evolving daily, there is a clear set of actions involving  digital and analytics that AF&L players should  implement now to keep the business going, stem  sales losses, and plan the comeback.  Engage with customers in an authentic way  Email, social media, and other digital channels have  seen significant spikes in usage during the crisis  (Exhibit 2).

Use  digital channels to launch genuine, purpose-driven  communications regarding health, safety, business  continuity, and community building.

While most AF&L players already have an  e-commerce presence, some still don’t. Companies  without one can launch a basic online platform in   10 to 15 weeks. A private-equity-backed retailer did  it in 13 weeks (Exhibit 4).

Retrain your look-alike models to capture value from  the new consumer segments and behaviors that  have emerged during the crisis. Upgrade your digital- marketing activity to be best-in-class—for example,  by adding sophisticated imagery to your social- media posts and conducting “social listening” to  inform the development of new services and offers.   Use granular data and advanced analytical tools  to manage stock The value of excess inventory from spring/summer  2020 collections is estimated at €140 billion to  €160 billion worldwide (between €45 billion and  €60 billion in Europe alone)—more than double the  normal levels for the sector. Clearing this excess  stock, both to ensure liquidity and to make room for  new collections, will become a top priority.  At the best-performing companies, an “inventory  war room” uses big data and advanced analytics to  first simulate dynamic demand scenarios specific to  locations (channel, country, store) and SKUs, then  to synthesize the resulting inventory risk—thus  enhancing decision making. The war room decides,  for example, whether to redistribute SKUs, transfer  inventory to future seasons, or accelerate markdowns  (Exhibit 5). A company’s investments in developing  advanced analytical tools to steer markdowns during  the crisis will pay off almost immediately.  Optimize costs using a zero-based approach In light of crisis-related sales decreases, cutting  costs is an obvious imperative for most companies.  However, reducing all budget lines across the board  is risky. We recommend a zero-based budgeting  approach instead.   Identify two categories of projects: critical projects  linked to core digital and analytics priorities that  must proceed as planned or at a slightly lower speed  (for example, building a new data lake to enable  personalized marketing) and core projects that  can be delayed (such as those that don’t enable   60  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   COVID Fashion Digital Exhibit 5 of 6  Exhibit 5 Using analytics, a company can quickly build sell-through scenarios and  synthesize resulting inventory risk.

Continue only the projects that  fall into those two categories; stop all others. A range  of savings levers—such as vendor renegotiations and  tactical moves to the cloud—can help dramatically  reduce your operating costs. Reset your digital and  analytics priorities and budget and adapt them to a  post-coronavirus world.   Shape the next normal: Longer-term  strategic actions Although time frames remain uncertain for now,  AF&L players should start planning how   they’ll compete in—and perhaps even influence— the industry’s next normal. Consumer habits,  companies’ interactions with consumers, and the  number and types of touchpoints will all change.   The requirements for supply-chain speed and   flexibility will continue to increase. Digital and  analytics will play a critical role in helping companies  emerge stronger from the crisis.   Set an ambitious aspiration and define a   clear road map A digital and analytics transformation is typically  an 18- to 24-month journey, requiring an ambitious  aspiration, a clear plan, and concrete milestones.  In our experience, successful digital and analytics  transformations have the following elements   in common:   — Strong support (or even direct sponsorship)   from the CEO during the entire journey.   — A pragmatic approach that starts with an   understanding of the consumer and the drivers   Fashion’s digital transformation: Now or never  61   of value creation; digital for digital’s sake will not  deliver results.   — A clear road map and prioritization of initiatives,  combining actions that help set up the enablers  for the organization with the implementation of  use cases that generate quick wins.    — A focus on getting to a minimum viable    product (MVP) within two to three months—a  rapid timeline that allows the company to   iterate while generating value, avoiding large  up-front investments.    — A central team to monitor value capture. This   team also helps build the road map by scanning  opportunities, allocating budgets, and  coordinating implementation, ensuring that  all efforts are focused on delivering tangible  impact rather than gold plating.  differ based on each company’s business model  and digital starting point. Digitization is much more  than just selling online; a quick diagnostic may be  required to select and align on key value areas.   Typically, digital and analytics priorities can be  categorized according to their place in the value  chain: customer experience (front), distribution and  supply chain (middle), and product development  and support functions (back). Exhibit 6 shows high- impact use cases in each of these three areas.  Provide an excellent omnichannel experience The pandemic has elevated digital channels as a  must-have for AF&L players. Therefore, take this  opportunity to leapfrog into the digital arena by  making it the center of your operating model: move  your traffic- and engagement-generation engine to  digital, and leverage digital channels to drive store  traffic and vice versa.  to measure success.   — Well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs)  GES 2020 COVID Fashion Digital Exhibit 6 of 6 The first step in the transformation program should  be the definition of digital priorities, which will   Besides scaling up digital sales efforts,  reconfigure your store footprint accordingly—for  example, by reducing presence in “B” areas  (markets with lower population density and lower  profitability per square meter), devoting less store   Exhibit 6 Digital and analytics can transform domains in every part of the apparel value chain.

Use data and analytics to tailor the assortment in   each store and to streamline and optimize  assortments overall.   In our experience, fully integrated management  of stock in stores and warehouses is core to any  omnichannel operation. Making all stock (even stock  shortly arriving to warehouses) visible to customers  in any channel has proved to boost sales.  Bet on personalization Personalization has helped several industry players  achieve 20 to 30 percent increases in customer  lifetime value across high-priority customer  segments. It has proved even more valuable in  subsectors with more stable and predictable  purchasing patterns, such as beauty products.  Use cases for personalization have mostly centered  on personalized offers, personalized promotions  and benefits (such as access to new products), and  reductions in generic traffic-generation costs. To go  further, add personalization capabilities to your digital  war room—for example, by collecting and analyzing  all the available data to generate detailed insights  about your customers. Build actionable microclusters   based on customer behavior. For instance, entice  the highest spenders with special incentives (such as  triple loyalty points for purchases of at least $1,000),  target customers who tend to buy in the categories  where you have the largest inventory buildup, and  give online customers coupons to redeem in-store  once physical stores reopen.  Prioritize use cases based on your business context,  advanced-analytics capabilities, and customer  segments. Create a prioritized use-case road  map and a technology-investment plan. Integrate  personalization into all delivery channels to ensure  consistency in your customer communications.   Leverage big data and analytics to manage   the supply chain Digital and analytics can not only drive top-line  growth but also significantly improve speed, cost,  flexibility, and sustainability across the supply  chain. For instance, some leading companies  are using radio-frequency identification (RFID)  to track products more precisely and reduce  in-store merchandising manipulation. Companies’  RFID investments typically yield operations  simplifications and service-level improvements.   In addition, automating logistics through digital  warehouse design and predictive exception  management can significantly increase efficiency.  The benefits will flow to consumers as well—in  the form of better product availability and faster,  cheaper, and more accurate deliveries. Leading  online players, for example, are using models   Fashion’s digital transformation: Now or never  63   powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to predict  sales of specific products in certain neighborhoods  and cities, then stocking the predicted amount of  inventory in nearby warehouses.   Digitize product development and   support functions  During the COVID-19 crisis, the digitization  of product development has proved to be a  competitive advantage. Companies that were  already using cutting-edge tools such as 3-D  product design, virtual sampling, digital material  libraries, and AI-supported planning have fared  better than their peers during the crisis. Their  designers and merchandisers can react faster to  market trends, significantly reduce both sample  costs and time-to-market, and collaborate remotely  across teams. The past several weeks have shown  that it’s possible to do much more on this front  than some in the industry initially thought. Indeed,  the pandemic may have shattered historical  preconceptions and biases against digitization in  core product-development processes.  Digitization of support functions is another key  lever for improving efficiency. By automating  repetitive tasks in back-office functions such as  indirect purchasing, finance, legal, and HR, you  can simultaneously reduce costs and free up  time and resources to reinvest in more valuable  activities. Companies that have automated their  finance processes—such as claims collection and  financial reconciliation—have found that they’ve  also increased the agility and accuracy of these  processes while capturing significant synergies.  Speed up the digitization of all support functions  through robotic process automation and other  leading-edge technologies.  Build data and tech enablers to support   your transformation Technical enablers play a key role in powering digital  and analytics growth. In our experience, three core  principles are the most relevant:    — Use cloud infrastructures to sustain scaling    and to access best-in-class services,  particularly for use cases that best benefit  from the cloud’s features (for instance, data  consumption across the globe, very high  storage and processing needs).   — Think data from the start. Build solid data   foundations as part of every digital and  analytics initiative in a way that allows rapid  scaling and forward compatibility. Design and  build out pragmatic data governance focused  on enabling business value by helping to ensure  data breadth, depth, and quality. Establish a  strong data culture and ethics.    — Design your technology stack for faster   integration and development, with applications  broken down into microservices and isolated  through the use of application programming  interfaces; use unified DevOps toolchains to  enable automation and reduce time-to-market  to a matter of hours instead of weeks.   These enablers shouldn’t become causes for   delay. Rather, they should follow the same agile  timelines and sprints as the core initiatives.  Implementation should be pragmatic and clearly  linked to value generation.   Attract and retain top digital talent  After the crisis, financially stable companies may  be able to attract top-notch digital talent, including  in-demand profiles such as digital-marketing  specialists, data scientists, data engineers, user- experience and user-interface designers, and  software and data architects. Retaining these  kinds of employees will require AF&L companies  to develop new talent processes—with tailored  initiatives in recruiting, career growth, learning and  development, and performance management— specifically for engineering and digital talent,  similar to what many fashion players already do for  designers and creative directors.  64  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   In addition, AF&L players should adopt agile ways  of working to speed up development of digital and  analytics products and projects. Agile techniques  enable companies to release MVPs into the  marketplace quickly and refine them iteratively  based on consumer feedback.   data-driven stock management, and digitization of  key functions—we believe they can not only endure  the crisis but also build competitive advantage  and strengthen their business for an omnichannel,  digital-centered next normal.   There’s no denying that the COVID-19 pandemic will  make for a difficult 2020. For some AF&L companies,  even survival may be a struggle.

All rights reserved.  65   © Laurence Dutton/Getty Images  Restore and reimagine:   Digital and analytics   imperatives for insurers  As the world recovers from the COVID-19 crisis, insurers should invest in digital  and analytics capabilities that will make them more customer-centric, simple, tech  driven—and competitive.  by Ramnath Balasubramanian, Krish Krishnakanthan, Johannes-Tobias Lorenz, Sandra Sancier-Sultan,   and Upasana Unni  66   When the world paused (and reorganized) its usual  activities to contain the spread of COVID-19, many  insurers demonstrated great resolve. As operations  stabilize—even as the macroeconomic environment  does not—the next phase must be focused on  embedding resilience and flexibility in organizations  and reimagining insurance for the next normal.   The COVID-19 crisis will cause structural shifts that  will have significant implications for the insurance  industry. An extended period of volatility, uncertainty,  and depressed economic activity will accelerate  ongoing changes in consumer behavior, needs, and  expectations. Some of these shifts will be irreversible.   Demand for digital interactions will spike and stay  elevated. In such an environment, digitally enabled  intermediaries and digital-only sales models are  proving to be effective and may be accelerating the  winner-take-all trend.   Customers will also be more acutely aware of their  personal and health risks and will demand solutions  to help them better manage these risks. These  shifts, combined with ongoing economic pressures,  will require insurers to develop radically simple  solutions, highly efficient operating models, and  consistently innovative business models.  Restore and reimagine  Strategic investment in comprehensive digital and  analytics capabilities will help insurers develop a  more detailed understanding of their clients and  determine the best ways to serve them. The work  is not only about technology; it will also require  significant investments in reskilling (and upskilling)  employees and reimagining the way they work.   Insurers should prioritize seven crucial digital and  analytics imperatives.   1. Digital upgrades for all channels Human interaction will remain pivotal in the future,  but stakeholders will expect all interactions to  have digital support. For instance, field agents will  adapt to remote selling with prioritized leads for  the “next-best conversation.”² Insurers will also use  analytics-derived segmentation to ensure retention,  which is especially important during the pandemic,  and to support cross-selling to microsegments. By  going digital, intake functions will support rapid  information gathering and become consistent for all  customers and intermediaries. This consistency will  be empathetic and low-stress for customers. Finally,  insurers will use digital and analytics capabilities  to shape remote recruiting for intermediaries and  service staff.  Accelerating investments in digital and analytics  initiatives that have long been under consideration  is a crucial strategic choice. Such investments  can be the difference between slowly declining  and flourishing. Indeed, our research shows that  across sectors, revenue growth (as measured by the  five-year compound annual growth rate) for digital  leaders is on average four times that of companies  that only dabble in disjointed digital initiatives.¹ For  many insurers, capturing the business value of  digital and analytics capabilities will require rapid  upgrades to technology platforms. Insurers have no  time to lose.  Such digital and data-driven interactions are already  in use. One North American financial-services  company uses proactive prospecting, which predicts  which prospects will have the highest value, to  increase their top advisers’ volume of new business  by 10 to 15 percent.  2. Customer lifetime value for better retention  and continuous engagement Retaining and growing revenue from an existing  customer is usually a better bet than acquiring  new clients. During the pandemic-fueled crisis,  insurers should therefore find ways to be relevant   1    For more on becoming a leading digital company, see Tanguy Catlin, Jay Scanlan, and Paul Willmott, “Raising your Digital Quotient,” June 2015,   2    The “next-best conversation” applies analytics to an organization’s existing data and knowledge about its customers to suggest ways to    McKinsey.com.  engage them.  Restore and reimagine: Digital and analytics imperatives for insurers  67   During the pandemic-fueled crisis,  insurers should find ways to be relevant  to their customers and engage them.  to their customers and engage them. Customer  engagement in this context requires an insurer to  understand the customer’s lifetime value through  the lenses of acquisition costs, insurance risks,  cost to service, cross-sell potential, and retention.  While some insurers are already promoting  retention with auto-premium refunds and up-front  commission payouts to brokers, maintaining a  clear view of economic viability and customer value  will be key to long-term recovery. Following the  crisis, insurers can further prioritize and improve  customer engagement by continuously fine-tuning  their understanding of customer value.   3. Friction-free underwriting and granular pricing Digital quoting and purchasing are becoming must- haves for all types of insurers. In life insurance,  AI engines can enable fluid-free underwriting  informed by public and private data—accessed  with customers’ consent. In property and casualty,  auto insurers have launched mobile apps that allow  customers to get an instant quote by submitting a  photo of their driver’s license.   Despite the importance of digital solutions, many  insurers struggle to fully digitize onboarding across  business lines. These incomplete digital onboarding  experiences often lack core functionality in areas  such as document verification, payments, and  digital signatures. With no in-person option to  accomplish these tasks, insurers should prioritize  comprehensive digital onboarding now. More- granular pricing (based on better data capture) is a  key way to finance these investments. For example,  a European insurer improved the combined ratio of   its small- to medium-enterprise business by more  than five percentage points over three years with  enhanced loss-prediction modeling and automated  underwriting decisions.  4. AI-driven capabilities for more   empathetic service  Insurance clients tend to look for clear answers  during times of uncertainty. Digital capabilities for  the service organization, particularly the call center,  will be critical to offering empathetic service. Some  insurers use AI to transfer information between  channels and create a seamless omnichannel  experience, letting chatbots and virtual agents  provide quick service and transferring customers  to traditional agents as needed. Insurers with a  good understanding of why customers are calling  can optimize calls and route them to the most  appropriate service professionals.   5. Next-generation claims model from intake   to payout  Companies with the capabilities to tap their troves  of claims data can create predictive models that  significantly improve claims outcomes. They can  conduct more effective return-to-work monitoring,  for example, and create better guidelines for  workers’ compensation and disability. Others will  improve severity prediction and early intervention,  including identification of claims likely to jump  in severity, such as short-term disability claims  that become long-term disability claims, auto  bodily injury claims, and worker’s compensation  claims. A North American auto insurer produced  a 3 to 5 percent improvement in payout accuracy   68  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   for auto bodily injury claims and a 5 to 8 percent  improvement in settlement time by using a  predictive severity model to identify which claims  should be sent to specialized claims handlers.   Claims are a promising area for mining additional  value. Insurers should invest in digital capabilities for  straight-through and low-touch claims processing— starting with digital-first notice of loss.   6. Workforce reskilling and new ways of working  To remain at the forefront of the industry, insurers  will need to have numerous employees with the  right technical skills and the commitment to  continuously upgrade these skills. Hiring the digital  talent needed to drive the necessary digital and  analytics transformation can be expensive and  time consuming. In response, leading insurers are  investing in long-term reskilling and upskilling to  harness the capabilities of their existing workforce  through personalized digital learning.   In parallel, insurers are accelerating the adoption   of agile practices. Several insurers across   North America, Europe, and Asia have started to  reorganize into agile tribes and squads that cut  across business, IT, and other support functions.  Switching to agile ways of working helped these  insurers bring their products to market two to four  times more quickly, improved customer satisfaction  scores by 10 to 25 percent, and raised productivity  by 10 to 30 percent.³   Finally, leading insurers use talent-to-value  diagnostics to ensure that they match the right   talent to high-value processes, all while building  the most important capabilities when reskilling   the workforce.⁴   7. New products and ecosystems Insurers should aspire to become more relevant to  their customers—to position themselves not just  as claims payers but as partners that help prevent  losses and support customers through challenges.  Now could be a good time to innovate and scale   up work on new products and ecosystems that  reflect new customer needs—for instance, in  health and prevention.   Ecosystems can also enable new growth,⁵ help  attract and retain customers, and make products  more viable. Some innovative insurers are  partnering with external players to offer customers  a full suite of services through external application  programming interfaces (APIs) and warm handoffs  between companies. Insurers should identify  partnership opportunities that align with their  business strategies and focus on a few partnerships  that can deliver value at scale. This approach helps  maintain focus and maximize payoff when working  with partners and within ecosystems.   Insurers should not postpone their digital and  analytics agendas. They can approach the current  moment as a chance to reimagine and rapidly  prioritize upgrades in their technology platforms.  The time to act—and to tap into the resulting  business value—is now.  3    For more on agile organizations, see Wouter Aghina, Karin Ahlback, Aaron De Smet, Gerald Lackey, Michael Lurie, Monica Murarka, and   Christopher Handscomb, The five trademarks of agile organizations, January 2018, McKinsey.com.  4    For more on linking talent to value, see Mike Barriere, Miriam Owens, and Sarah Pobereskin, “Linking talent to value,” McKinsey Quarterly, April   2018, McKinsey.com.  5    For more on deriving value from ecosystems, see Tanguy Catlin, Ulrike Deetjen, Johannes-Tobias Lorenz, Jahnavi Nandan, and Shirish   Sharma, “Ecosystems and platforms: How insurers can turn vision into reality,” March 12, 2020, McKinsey.com.

Restore and reimagine: Digital and analytics imperatives for insurers  69   © Richard Johnson/Getty Images  Inside a mining company’s   AI transformation  How copper-mining giant Freeport-McMoRan unlocked next-level performance  with help from McKinsey data scientists and agile coaches.  by Red Conger, Harry Robinson, Richard Sellschop  70   The mood was apprehensive as data scientists, metallurgists, and engineers from Freeport-McMoRan  filed into the control room of a copper-ore concentrating mill in Bagdad, Arizona, on the morning of  October 19, 2018. They had come to learn what would happen when they cranked the big mill up to a work  rate that had never been tried.   The possibility of causing problems at the mill weighed on everyone’s mind. The team members had initially  resisted the idea of running the mill faster. They wanted to keep the stockpile of ore that feeds the mill from  dropping below the minimum size they had long maintained. Their concern was that a too-small stockpile  would hamper the mill’s performance.  Whether the minimum stockpile size actually helped the mill run better was another matter. No one really  knew for sure. Nor could the mill’s managers and staff say what would happen if the stockpile shrank to less  than the traditional minimum.   As the weeks went by, the copper-ore concentrating   mill sustained a faster pace with no loss of efficiency.   The data model had been right: the mill could handle   more ore than its operators thought.  What they did know is that a custom-built artificial-intelligence (AI) model, loaded with three years’ worth of  operating data from the mill and programmed to look for operational tweaks that would boost output, kept  saying copper production would rise if the mill were fed with more ore per minute.   To the mill operators, that notion sounded logical enough—except that it didn’t account for the minimum  stockpile size they had in mind. But the model didn’t know, or care, about minimum stockpile size or any of  the mill operators’ other ideas about how the mill ought to be run.  With permission from company executives, the crew members at the Bagdad site decided to turn up the  pace of the mill as the model had suggested. They also prepared to ramp up mining and crushing activities  so the stockpile of ore wouldn’t run out.  At ten o’clock in the morning, a technician clicked a control on his computer screen to speed up the system  of conveyor belts carrying chunks of ore from the crusher to the stockpile and from the stockpile to the mill.  Everyone in the room kept watch on the 13 oversize monitors in the control room, which were lit up with  readings from hundreds of performance sensors placed around the mill. The quantity of ore grinding  through the mill rose. No warnings went up.   Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  71   Twelve hours passed. The mill held steady. Even when its stockpile of ore dipped below the usual minimum,  the accelerated delivery of ore from the crusher and the mine allowed the mill to keep going. As the weeks  went by, the mill sustained the faster pace with no loss of efficiency. The data model had been right: the mill  could handle more ore than its operators thought.  “That was the breakthrough we’d been looking for,” Justin Cross, the Bagdad site’s general manager,  told us. “Once we started to run the mill at full speed, we knew we could get results from more of the  recommendations that the model was making.”   Grinding-mill operator Megan Alford monitors  the bank of screens displaying details of the   copper ore churning in the main mill just beyond  the glass.  72  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   The ‘age of the operator’ The story of how Freeport-McMoRan learned to rely on an AI model as much as the intuition of veteran  mining engineers and metallurgists might not raise eyebrows outside the tech industry.   For mining companies, though, it illustrates a quiet but profound shift into an era we think of as the “age  of the operator,” when the best-run businesses wring profits out of low-grade ore that miners would have  waved off as waste just ten years ago.  One mine where Freeport-McMoRan had been processing declining ore grades is Bagdad, a sprawling  Arizona complex where prospectors staked their first claims in 1882. Bagdad’s reserves of higher-grade ore  have been depleted for some time, but Freeport-McMoRan has sustained the mine’s production of copper  by making various process improvements.  By the end of 2017, executives believed that Bagdad had gotten as efficient as it could get with its existing  equipment, so they reasoned that adding capacity would be the surest way to get even more copper  out of the site. Early in 2018, they started planning a $200 million capital expansion of Bagdad’s ore- concentrating mill that would lift production by 20 percent.   Copper prices were high at the time. The investment looked certain to pay off.   Then copper prices dropped from a five-year peak of around $3.30 per pound in early June to $2.75 or so a  month later. All of a sudden, investing $200 million to expand Bagdad no longer seemed practical.   Instead, Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process changes that would increase Bagdad’s  copper output without a massive injection of capital.   Discovering improvements at an efficient mine wouldn’t be easy. But Freeport-McMoRan had plenty  of high-quality information to study. Around ten years before, Bert Odinet, Freeport-McMoRan’s chief  information officer, coordinated an effort to standardize the way that each site measures and reports its  performance and to build a central data warehouse for storing those measurements.   Several years later, maintenance teams lobbied for the installation of additional network equipment and  performance sensors on the company’s trucks, power shovels, and stationary machines. The teams would  manually download data from those sensors to the data warehouse so they could further sharpen their  maintenance practices and improve the functioning of equipment.  Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders resolved to find new process  changes that would increase the site’s copper output  without a massive injection of capital.  Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  73   When wireless mesh networks became cost effective and reliable, Freeport-McMoRan installed them at  all its sites. Now the company could capture and correlate second-by-second performance readings in the  data warehouse, all in real time.  “We learned things we’d have never predicted,” Odinet said. “That project taught us to be more receptive to  what the data was telling us. And it gave us the confidence to try more complicated analyses.”  With advanced analytics and AI techniques, Freeport-McMoRan could scan the vast quantity of data it  collected, identify even more operational changes that might raise performance, and put them to the test in  the field.   Allison (Allie) Naltazan is in training to become  a mill operator on the ore-grinding line. Around  her, the ore chutes and barrels create a constant  grinding, clanging roar as the rock tumbles   and breaks. This is her office. She has to shout  to be heard.  74  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Bagdad looked like a good proving ground for this method. The site is staffed with creative, open-minded  engineers, metallurgists, and equipment operators who stood out at Freeport-McMoRan for their  willingness to try new things. Their earlier efforts to enhance Bagdad’s metallurgical processes, for   example, had resulted in higher copper recovery.  And Cross, Bagdad’s general manager, was a natural tinkerer who liked to spend his free time outfitting his  pickup truck for off-road use and milling mesquite logs into lumber for a house he planned to build himself.  Since joining Freeport-McMoRan in 2006, Cross had led a series of projects to streamline operations at the  company’s mines.   It also helped that Bagdad’s operations were stable. With few equipment problems or process hiccups to  straighten out, workers would have time to help increase copper production.  Executives felt that promising opportunities to boost Bagdad’s production could be found in one part of  the operation: the ore-concentrating mill, a noisy facility where huge milling machines and flotation cells  bubbling with chemical solutions turn grapefruit-size rocks containing around 0.4 percent copper into a  fine-ground mix of 25 percent copper and 75 percent rock.  The mill’s technicians ran the facility strictly by the book, a set of operating instructions that Freeport- McMoRan engineers in Phoenix had developed. There had to be ways of building on those instructions that  would better the mill’s performance.  After talking things over with engineers and operations specialists from Bagdad and from headquarters,  Freeport-McMoRan CEO Richard Adkerson and CFO Kathleen Quirk decided to let the crew at Bagdad  work with McKinsey on a new kind of mining project: data mining in an agile way.   Learning agile The project called for more than sophisticated data science. It also called  for a new approach to solving tricky operational problems.  “Usually when we run operational projects, we overengineer them. We test  every conceivable scenario, build in safeguards, and do everything we can  to ensure that a process change will result in an improvement before we  make it,” Cross observed. “It’s a dependable way to get good results. But it  takes a huge amount of time, effort, and capital investment.”  McKinsey’s consultants reckoned that the crew at Bagdad might  get better results, more quickly, by carrying out the analytics project  differently. They introduced the idea of working under agile principles,  which emphasize quick development of functional solutions that teams  then improve, little by little, according to feedback from users.   Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  75   The general manager assembled a team of people  representing every division of the mill, along with other  parts of the organization they would need to work with,  such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central   data-science group.  Another essential feature of agile methods is face-to-face collaboration within well-rounded teams. Cross  assembled a team of people representing every division of the mill, along with other parts of the organization  they would need to work with, such as the mine and Freeport-McMoRan’s central data-science group.  The composition of the team allowed it to tap the expertise and account for the interests of each division of  Bagdad that its work might affect. It also enabled the team to contend better with challenges that involved  different divisions and couldn’t be solved by one division alone.  The team’s agile approach was to work in “sprints”—two-week bouts of activity in which the team conceived  a data-modeling function or operational change, tested it, and learned what would make it better.   As improvements came to light, the team would add them to a backlog. Then it would plow through the items  on the backlog in subsequent sprints, starting with the easiest, most beneficial tasks.  For Bagdad’s crew members, this agile style of working wasn’t just different from business as usual. It  represented a radical departure from the way they’d been doing things.  “It took us a while to get comfortable with agile,” Cross said. “We had to let go of a lot of old habits.”  McKinsey brought in agile coaches to help. The coaches explained the rudiments of agile—building a  backlog, deciding what to accomplish in each sprint, holding morning meetings to agree on the work the  crew would perform each day and to note any difficulties that might slow it down—but were mainly there   to join the team’s activities and teach its members to work together in agile ways.  Shannon Lijek, a McKinsey partner who specializes in helping organizations apply agile methods, was one of  the coaches who came to help the Bagdad team get the hang of agile.  76  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   “We’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to jump  right in,” said McKinsey partner Shannon Lijek.  “Agile can be tricky to adopt at first because it isn’t a process you can memorize. It’s a set of principles for  minimizing wasted effort and getting more work done. And we’ve found that the best way to learn agile is to  jump right in,” Lijek said.  One way that Bagdad’s agile team cut out needless effort was by introducing solutions as soon as it had built  “minimum viable products,” or MVPs, that were good enough to use, rather than laboring to perfect those  products first.  “If we’d built the model ourselves, we’d have tried to get it 100 percent right before doing anything with it,”  Cross told us.  “Shannon and the McKinsey coaches encouraged us to work with solutions that weren’t finished. They’d say,  ‘You can get 60 percent of the improvement with an MVP, and that’s a lot. So just start using it. Then you can  worry about making it better.’”  From predicting to optimizing Once the team Cross formed came together, it began investigating the possibility of improving the mill’s  performance. The idea was to spend a month examining data from the mill for patterns that revealed  potential improvements. If those improvements looked promising enough, the team would pursue them.  Beginning in late June, the Bagdad team and data scientists from McKinsey built a machine-learning model  to check whether the mill truly ran as efficiently as people believed. The model, a type of extreme gradient- boosting model, consisted of an ensemble of thousands of decision trees that had been engineered to  include a great deal of metallurgical knowledge.   The staff at Bagdad and Freeport-McMoRan’s central operations group believed all the ore entering the mill  was of the same type. Consequently, they had defined a single “recipe” of lower and upper parameters for  the mill’s 42 control settings: the mix of differently sized ore chunks being fed into the mill, the pH level in the  flotation cells, and so on.   But when the agile team at Bagdad ran the data from the mill’s performance sensors through its model, the  members of the team learned something new. From the mill’s perspective, the mine was actually producing  seven distinct types of ore.  What’s more, the mill’s standard recipe for control settings didn’t match the properties of all those ore types.  Ore containing more iron pyrite, for example, would yield more copper if the pH level in the flotation cells  were set higher than the recipe prescribed.  Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  77   “Thinking about ore clusters in terms of data from the mill’s instruments, rather than classifications from  traditional geology, was a major mindset shift—and it opened up many new possibilities for improving  performance,” said Sean Buckley, a McKinsey partner who led the analytics work.  All told, the team’s analysis suggested that adjusting the mill’s controls to suit each of the seven ore types  could increase copper production by 10 percent or more.   That prospect convinced Freeport-McMoRan’s leaders to let the agile team at Bagdad build an AI model  that would look at the ore coming into the mill and suggest control settings to heighten production of copper  from that ore.  To determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield,  staff decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing  copper production at a reasonable cost, with little   new capital investment.  Team members wrote algorithms to discern the connections among the  ore type, the operational readings from the plant’s sensors, the amount  of ore running through the mill, and the amount of copper recovered.  Next, they developed more algorithms to predict the plant’s performance  based on measurements from the sensors.  After several weeks of development sprints, the team had raised the  accuracy of the model’s performance predictions to 96 percent—  high enough to know that the model was properly interpreting the   data streaming in from the mill’s sensors and relating it to the mill’s   control settings.  Mill operator II Floyd (George) Mocaby and senior  metallurgist Rahul Singh review the alarms on the  gantry system.  The team then turned its attention from predicting performance to improving  it. Staff began by asking a simple question that no one had asked in some  time: What measure of performance do we want to optimize?  For years, the team at Bagdad had oriented its decisions and activities  toward particular targets for copper production and operating cost. That  approach made a certain kind of sense. It meant that Bagdad consistently  generated profits.  Now, to determine just how much copper Bagdad could yield, the team  decided to establish a new mandate—maximizing copper production at a  reasonable cost, with little new capital investment.  78  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Introducing AI and agile to mining operations:  Lessons from Bagdad by Red Conger Freeport-McMoRan’s effort to increase copper production  at Bagdad taught us a good deal about how to use agile  methods and AI tools at our sites, where it can be difficult to  alter accepted routines. Here are a few things we’re keeping in  mind as we expand the use of agile and AI to more of Freeport- McMoRan’s operations:   — Don’t wait for the “perfect” product or solution to begin using   it. Once it’s working well enough, implement it right away.  Immediate action brings immediate results.   — Be willing to reconsider and discard long-standing   assumptions and processes if you find better ways to do  things. That means validating your new ideas through data  analysis and fieldwork.   — Empower frontline teams to take risks. That’s how testing and  learning happens. Set clear boundaries on what teams can try.  Make it clear they won’t be blamed if their experiments come  up short or incur extra costs.   — Use data science to catalyze decision making. Human judgment   and intuition are hard to replace, but people can make better  decisions when they’re informed by analytical findings.   — Once you create value with agile and AI, spread the word about   what you did and how you did it. Showcasing success will  attract interest in these capabilities and motivate colleagues to  adopt them.   Red Conger is president and COO, Americas, of   Freeport-McMoRan.  Maximizing production could lessen performance in other  areas. Nonetheless, executives agreed that if Bagdad could  increase production as the model predicted, the short-term  cost would be worth it.  Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  79   Cross and Cory Stevens, Freeport-McMoRan’s vice president of operational improvement, knew that  maximizing production could lessen Bagdad’s performance in other areas. The mill’s recovery rate—the  percentage of copper extracted from the ore—might drop. Or the whole operation could come to a halt   for hours.  Stevens went to other executives to explain that Bagdad’s experiment could be costly. The performance  numbers they’d see for the next few months might be dismal, he warned.   Nonetheless, the executives agreed with Stevens that if Bagdad could achieve the 10 percent increase in  production that the model predicted, the short-term cost would be worth it. They gave him the go-ahead to  try maximizing production.  With that approval, Cross granted Bagdad’s staff the latitude to make operational changes that deviated  from standard procedures and could cause the mill to miss its performance targets. Worker safety and  equipment integrity were the only areas where no compromises or experiments would be allowed. Any other  changes were fair game.  A big breakthrough Over a series of iterations during the next month or so, the team conceived, tested, and refined algorithms  that would look at sensor-generated data and recommend control settings to maximize copper output. The  new algorithms, known as genetic algorithms, used the principles of natural selection to “evolve” settings  that would produce the most copper, given a particular type of ore.  Most challenging were the model’s recommendations to  depart from the operational recipe that the staff at Bagdad  had been following for years. The agile team spent a lot of  time debating what to do with those.  By early September, the team had expanded the prediction model into   an MVP of an optimization model, dubbed TROI, that was capable of  issuing recommendations every 12 hours, once for each of the mill’s   two daily shifts.   When each new set of recommendations came out, the engineers,  equipment operators, and metallurgists on the team would huddle and  decide what do to with them.   TROI was a work in progress, so its earliest recommendations weren’t  entirely reliable. At every shift, metallurgists from Freeport-McMoRan and  from McKinsey would study the model’s recommendations and question  whether they were credible. Then the metallurgists would take note of the  problem recommendations so the agile team could look into them.  Metallurgist I Alaina Mallard, senior metallurgist  Rahul Singh, and mill operator II Floyd (George)  Mocaby discuss the expert system inside the ore  crusher’s control room.  80  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Mill-diagnostic mechanic Fernando Hoenig  leans against a copper-ore press inside the   ore-concentrating mill. It is the machine he  works on most.  Some recommendations led the team members to discover flaws in TROI’s logic, which they added to  their backlog and corrected in subsequent development sprints. Others indicated that the underlying  performance data were faulty and prompted the team to look for fixes.   “TROI helps us to improve the quality of our instrumentation and highlights sensors that need attention,”   said Frank Ochoa, one of Bagdad’s process-control and instrumentation engineers.   Most challenging were the recommendations to depart from the operational recipe the staff had been  following for years. The agile team spent a lot of time debating what to do with those.   Gradually, as the team fine-tuned TROI, its recommendations became more plausible, and the staff at  Bagdad began following them. Yet many of those recommendations resulted in slim performance gains,   if any.  Mid-October arrived. The team was nowhere close to the 10 percent production boost it thought possible.  Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  81   Cross and Stevens decided it was time to act on a weighty recommendation that no one was especially  eager to try: speeding the flow of ore from the mine and the crusher to the mill. Cross asked the mine  operators to redline their activities—and reassured them that they wouldn’t be blamed for spending more  money or triggering operational breakdowns.  The mine operators ramped up blasting, even though they had to use more explosives. They queued up  trucks to carry rocks to the crushing plant, in violation of a long-standing directive to keep trucks from  standing idle. They choke-fed the giant crusher with run-of-mine, or unprocessed, ore to find out how much  it could handle.   Finally, on October 19, the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate. Right away, copper production jumped  5 percent. TROI had helped the team unlock a record level of performance.   Small gains add up Having achieved a major performance gain, Bagdad’s agile team turned  to enhancing the model’s ability to recommend mill-control settings that  would increase copper production.  TROI could already identify which type of ore was running through the mill  at any moment. In the next round of sprints, the team added functions to  account for other incoming operational data.  Each time TROI recommended a set of control settings, the metallurgists  at the plant would consider the recommendations, choose which ones  to accept, and pass them to shift supervisors and operators, who would  adjust the mill’s controls accordingly.  Letting the metallurgists decide which recommendations to follow helped the agile team learn more quickly.  Occasionally, the metallurgists applied settings that looked questionable just to find out whether they would  work. And when the metallurgists rejected the recommended settings, they typed notes into the model to  explain their decisions.  “TROI doesn’t always give fully accurate recommendations, but it provides a new perspective on how to  manage the plant and challenges our assumptions,” said Lulu Raymond, a senior metallurgist at Bagdad.  As soon as the team pushed up the mill’s processing rate,  copper production jumped 5 percent. The model had  helped the team unlock a record level of performance.  82  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Metallurgist II Elliot Britvec watches over the  ore-concentrating mill at Bagdad. Conveyor  belts carry copper ore from a constantly  replenished stockpile behind the mill into each  of the massive grinding drums. “Like sand in a  never-ending hour glass.”  Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  83   The agile team reviewed the data model’s recordings  and the metallurgists’ notes every day and kept working  through a backlog of upgrades. Within several weeks,   the team had refined the model to the point that  metallurgists were accepting more than 80 percent   of its recommendations.  All the while, sensors gauged the mill’s performance. The model’s machine- learning algorithms recorded which settings improved performance and  which ones didn’t, and whether the recommendations were helping.  The agile team reviewed the model’s recordings and the metallurgists’  notes every day, added items to the backlog of upgrades it planned to  make, and kept working on those upgrades. By early December, the  team had refined TROI to the point that metallurgists were accepting  more than 80 percent of its recommendations.   It wasn’t long before the metallurgists and mill operators began trying to  outsmart TROI. They would monitor the type of ore passing into the mill,  anticipate the control settings that the model might suggest, and   apply those settings before the model made its twice-daily recommen- dations (later increased to every three hours). This became a kind of  competition: Who can run the mill better than TROI would?  Most important, the mill’s production increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bagdad’s  throughput exceeded 85,000 tons of ore per day—10 percent more than the previous quarter—while its  copper-recovery rate rose by one percentage point and its operations became more stable (exhibit). The  following quarter, copper production at Bagdad went up yet again.  Those gains should lift Bagdad’s copper production by 20 million pounds per year, an increase that has allowed  Freeport-McMoRan to avoid most of the $200 million capital expansion of the Bagdad concentrator complex.  84  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Mining AI transformation Exhibit 1 of 1  Exhibit By following recommendations from  the arti(cid:12)cial-intelligence model,  a copper mill’s operators increased  throughput by 10 percent.

Having learned to maintain TROI during the project, the  company’s metallurgists and data scientists now run the  model themselves, without ongoing support from McKinsey.  They study daily and weekly reports that compare the mill’s  performance with TROI’s predictions, and they continue  enhancing the model’s ability to make recommendations.  Freeport-McMoRan executives have also sponsored the  creation of a second agile team at Bagdad to test and make  process improvements at the mine. This team, too, is working  without help from McKinsey, using the agile methods that it  learned on the mill project.  At another one of Freeport-McMoRan’s Arizona copper mines,  Morenci, managers have kicked off an agile and analytics  effort like Bagdad’s. And the company will soon launch its most  ambitious program of this kind at Cerro Verde, a copper mine in  Peru with five times the capacity of Bagdad.

Inside a mining company’s AI transformation  85   86   The special  challenge of   cybersecurity 88  COVID-19 crisis shifts  cybersecurity priorities and  budgets  95  Cybersecurity tactics for  the coronavirus pandemic  101  Cybersecurity’s dual  mission during the  coronavirus crisis  87   © Erik Isakson/Getty Images  COVID-19 crisis shifts   cybersecurity priorities   and budgets  Cybersecurity technology and service providers are shifting priorities to support  current needs: business continuity, remote work, and planning for transition to the  next normal.  by Venky Anant, Jeffrey Caso, and Andreas Schwarz  88   Few corporate functions shifted priorities so  much and so quickly when the COVID-19 crisis  struck as corporate cybersecurity operations and  the technology providers that support them did. As  legions of employees suddenly found themselves  in a work-from-home model, chief information- security officers (CISOs) adjusted, pivoting from  working on routine tasks and toward long-term  goals to establishing secure connections for newly  minted remote workforces. CISOs also took steps  to prevent new network threats that target remote  workers and to bolster business-facing operations  and e-commerce after a surge in online shopping  during pandemic lockdowns.   The response to the crisis continues to press  department budgets and limit resources for other,  less essential functions—a situation that we believe  will direct spending in fiscal year 2021, which many  departments are beginning to plan for. According  to new McKinsey research, overall spending should  taper off from the sector’s recent rapid growth in  industries that were hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis  while holding steady in industries that have not been  as affected.  The challenges that cybersecurity organizations  face have spilled over to technology providers.  Those companies have done their own pivots to  keep up with customers’ shifting needs and to  institute new ways of doing business. To succeed  in the post-COVID-19 era, technology providers  must rethink their strategies and offerings to  accommodate a new security landscape. And they  must continue to monitor customers’ needs and  adjust sales, service, and training accordingly.  COVID-19 crisis’s impact on  cybersecurity spending CISOs responded to the pandemic by quickly  instituting measures to maintain business continuity  and protect against new cyberthreats. To manage  continuity, they have been patching remote systems  over virtual private networks (VPNs) that have   strained under increased loads. They have been  monitoring spiking threat levels, including a near- sevenfold increase in spear-phishing attacks, since  the pandemic began. Remote workers are also  being bombarded with attacks based on COVID-19- crisis themes that are taking advantage of delayed  updates to email and web filters, and using social  engineering to prey on workforce concerns.   Many CISOs’ fiscal 2020 budgets had already been  allocated before the pandemic, so to cover the  cost of addressing the crisis, they had to put other  projects on hold. According to our research, which  covers more than 250 global CISOs and security  professionals, the crisis-inspired security measures  will remain top budget priorities in the third and  fourth quarters of 2020.   More than 70 percent of security executives also  believe that their budgets for fiscal year 2021  will shrink, according to the survey. As a result,  supporting new tactics to safeguard organizations  is expected to limit outlays for such things as  compliance, governance, and risk tools. For  corporate security-operations centers, the cost of  securing the fundamentals could reduce budgets  for more advanced threat-intelligence upgrades,  behavioral analytics, and other tooling.  In our client work, we have seen those priorities play  out in many ways, including the following:   — A software company rerouted resources  that had been designated for a security- automation project to cover gaps in multifactor  authentication (MFA).   — A consumer-packaged-goods company   postponed holding cybersecurity “war games”  and diverted the resources to accelerate the  rollout of a VPN.   — A financial-services company postponed “red   team” exercises to close vulnerabilities in  remote-work applications.  COVID-19 crisis shifts cybersecurity priorities and budgets  89   >70% of CISOs and security buyers   believe budgets will shrink by  the end of 2020 but plan to  ask for significant increases  in 2021.   — In the next 12 months, spending will vary by  industry (exhibit). For financial-services and  insurance industries, for example, we expect  to see budget increases for specific segments,  such as security controls for the cloud- based business functions that more of those  companies are adopting.  Our research suggests that other industries will  not fare as well. Spending for healthcare payers  should track with precrisis allocations but could  taper off in the last half of the fiscal year because  of budget constraints. Healthcare providers that  have been on the front line of the crisis have had to  adjust operations to interact with patients digitally  and virtually, including through telemedicine.  Implementing those new technologies have dug into  operations budgets, and such companies could cut  back on cybersecurity spending as a result. We also expect retail companies’ cybersecurity  budgets to contract in line with lost revenues.  However, an increase in online shopping means  that some retailers are prioritizing investments in  security for digital-payment platforms to support  the evolving needs of their customers.  In most cases, we expect cybersecurity spending at  large enterprises to bounce back faster than that at  small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).  Spending hot spots Many companies are giving some or all employees  the option of working remotely on a long-term or  permanent basis. We expect other companies to  reopen their physical offices in waves, welcoming  back essential workers first, then other employees,  and finally contractors, vendors, and other third  parties. For industries that must maintain a sterile  environment, such as healthcare, the process of  returning nonessential people to the office could  stretch even longer.   Based on those trends, other recent activity, and  insights gleaned from our research, we believe  CISOs and cybersecurity-operations teams will  continue to make the following security niches high  priorities for spending:   — Perimeter security. Companies will continue to   prioritize short-term spending on security for  remote workers. We also expect them to spend  on e-commerce security that can be scaled to  cover increased activity (including the SMEs that  use third parties to provide such services). That  could result in higher spending on pay-per-seat  and pay-per-megabyte licenses and ultimately  cause companies to shift additional funds from  in-house systems to outsourced services.  90  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Web <2020> <COVID-cyber> Exhibit <1> of <1> Exhibit The COVID-19 crisis is expected to shift cybersecurity spending by industry  The COVID-19 crisis is expected to shift cybersecurity spending by industry  and product category. and product category.

Source: Expert interviews; McKinsey analysis  COVID-19 crisis shifts cybersecurity priorities and budgets  91    — Next-generation identity and access controls.   Companies that had deferred adding MFA to  legacy systems are accelerating its adoption  or are moving to cloud platforms. With more  employees working remotely, teams managing  business-critical systems are revisiting who  qualifies for privileged access. CISOs at  medium-size companies are likely to prioritize  managing privileged-access and identity- governance solutions that integrate with  security-information and event-management  tools and with advanced security analytics to  save time and money.   — Remote access. CISOs will continue to support   virtual work-arounds for help-desk staff  who would work in the office under normal  circumstances. A virtual security help desk  assists remote workers with access issues that  also support productivity, such as email security  tokens and remote desktop access. At SMEs in  particular, we expect to see higher than average  spending on MFA services that integrate with  collaboration tools and system-as-a-service  solutions, including file sharing, virtual-desktop  infrastructure, and communication platforms.    — Automation. Companies that can automate  routine tasks can free up time for other work  that adds more value. At organizations that  use outsourced services, we expect CISOs to  ask managed-service providers to make up for  increased workloads by adding such automated  services as security orchestration automation  and response tooling rather than by increasing  staff or budgets.   — Security training. The crisis has provided   companies with an opportunity to drive home  cybersecurity’s importance to the workforce,  especially frontline employees. We expect that  the cyberawareness training—that developed  in- house and that delivered by an outside  provider—that CISOs offer will be adapted  both to cover remote-work situations and   bring-your-own-device policies and to be  delivered virtually.   — Security for trusted third parties. Companies   that provide network access to contractors  or other trusted partners need to protect  those parties from outside attacks, since such  threats could affect their own security. We  expect to see companies increase monitoring  for potential threats, which could increase  budgets for click-of-a-button security-ratings  tools, security-risk assessments, and security- reporting instruments—however, these  expenses will not likely be prioritized until  after any technical security gaps made more  relevant by COVID-19 (for example, remote  access security, multifactor authentication)  have been closed.  Next normal for cybersecurity providers  Companies’ actions to maintain business continuity  and protect remote workers will likely have  ramifications for cybersecurity providers over the  12 to 18 months (the time that CISOs estimate it will  take for security organizations to reach the next  normal). Plans for permanent remote work, phased  reopening, and limited interaction with nonessential  visitors will boost interest in some cybersecurity  products and services but curb it for others. That  will change how providers need to interact with  customers and prospects:   — Product refreshes could decrease. To address   budget constraints, CISOs are considering  extending how long they use security  applications before upgrading, especially for  hardware-based services (such as firewalls).  They also will prioritize paying for new features  or patches for only the most critical applications.  That could make organizations more vulnerable  to attacks on their technology stacks, creating  a business opportunity for providers to offer  additional or new technologies or services.  92  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020    — Go-to-market touchpoints will shift. Until   regions reopen completely, providers’ sales  and marketing representatives can’t meet  face to face with security-team personnel. The  nimblest will find other ways to keep in touch  and provide extra value, such as by switching to  video calls and using a customer-engagement  application to record touchpoints.   — Delivering services will be more challenging.  Providers won’t be able to send technicians or  other staff to a customer’s facility to install or  run an outsourced service, respond to a crisis,  or help with a transformation project. In that  absence, we forecast that demand for remote  services and permissions under restricted  access will increase.    — The market for security and training will grow.   With cyberthreats to remote workers increasing,  companies are motivated to boost training to  improve awareness and educate them about  cyber hygiene. Providers that can offer such  services should be prepared to deliver them  virtually, including for real-time interventions.    — Customers may be open to replatforming.   CISOs that need to bring services in line with  current needs may be more inclined to move  those applications to new platforms, including  the cloud. It may be easier to add MFA and  single-sign-on features on modern cloud  platforms than to bolt those features onto an  older platform. If that’s the case, rip-and-replace  scenarios could present providers with an  opportunity to negotiate new deals, especially if  they can reduce cyberfriction and disruptions.   — Short-term pricing strategies could open doors.   CISOs faced with budget pressures may need  to revisit cybersecurity-services contracts  to maximize value and cut costs. If providers  are able, they could use the opportunity to  extend licenses for a period of time without  negative financial consequences to customers.   That could solidify relationships while setting  the stage for future contract extensions or  renegotiations.   What cybersecurity providers can do In the short term, we expect CISOs to continue to  prioritize situations related to remote work and  business continuity. But eventually, we expect  the emergence of a phase of hybrid activity—one  in which CISOs both take care of their immediate  needs and begin to resume limited support for  longer-term or strategic cybersecurity imperatives.   Providers can use this period of time to solidify  existing relationships and build new ones as   trusted partners and influencers. To get there,   we recommend providers focus on the following   key areas:   — Anticipate customers’ needs. Understand the  issues that security teams face to determine  which products and services could best meet  their needs. Security teams will be focused on  supporting technology and security features— capabilities and services that are critical to  their organizations’ operations. Those needs  will vary by team. An end-point-security team,  for example, might focus on bring-your-own- device issues, and a network-security team  may need to deal with VPN load to support  a workforce split between working from the  office and working from home. Similarly, needs  may vary by company. A large insurance  company might need to prioritize General  Data Protection Regulation compliance as it  accelerates the move of its business systems  to the cloud, and a midsize utility might need to  focus on network segmentation.   — Adjust approaches and technologies to   address urgent problems. Develop a pitch that  links an organization’s mission statement to the  issues that its customers are currently facing. If  the business case is right, look at opportunities   COVID-19 crisis shifts cybersecurity priorities and budgets  93   to expand beyond the company’s traditional  wheelhouse through acquisition or in-house  development of new capabilities. Opportunities  to expand should sync with the areas in which  CISOs are accelerating their own road maps,  particularly maintaining security operations,  mitigating the risk of remote access to sensitive  data and software-development environments,  and implementing MFA to enable employees to  continue working remotely.   — Assess the portfolio. Times have changed. The  solutions that a customer needs today may be  different from when a provider first developed  its portfolio, and it may need to shift its offerings  as a result. After evaluating which products  or services are likely to be more attractive in  the recovery and next normal, providers can  reorient engineering, sales, and marketing  resources to support them. Play up the most  compelling aspects of an integrated offering.  If it is unclear that proprietary technology will  continue to dominate a specific niche, it could  be an opportunity to help customers optimize  cybersecurity expenditures by suggesting open- source frameworks and solutions.   — Invest in relationships. When customers   look back on this era, they will remember the  partners that stuck with them. When providers  can’t build revenue, they can build relationships.  Companies will continue to adjust security  models to the requirements of different markets  and regulators, and providers can help them by  offering guidance and best practices.  CISOs that acted quickly to reorient security to  cover remote workers and business continuity  during the COVID-19 crisis must now prepare for  the future. Such preparation includes determining  how to allocate limited cybersecurity budgets to  support additional modifications. Cybersecurity  providers must shift their approaches, becoming  trusted partners and influencers to help customers  maximize their spending while preparing for the   next normal.

But new tactics can help cybersecurity leaders to safeguard  their organizations.  by Jim Boehm, James Kaplan, Marc Sorel, Nathan Sportsman, and Trevor Steen   95   The COVID-19 pandemic has presented chief  information security officers (CISOs) and their teams  with two immediate priorities. One is securing work- from-home arrangements on an unprecedented  scale now that organizations have told employees  to stop traveling and gathering, and government  officials in many places have advised or ordered  their people to stay home as much as possible. The  other is maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of consumer-facing network traffic as  volumes spike—partly as a result of the additional  time people are spending at home.   Recent discussions with cybersecurity leaders  suggest that certain actions are especially helpful  to fulfill these two priorities. In this article, we  set out the technology modifications, employee- engagement approaches, and process changes that  cybersecurity leaders have found effective.  Securing work-from-home  arrangements at scale The rapid, widespread adoption of work-from- home tools has put considerable strain on security  teams, which must safeguard these tools without  making it hard or impossible for employees to work.  Conversations with CISOs in Asia, Europe, and  North America about how they are securing these  new work-at-home arrangements highlight the  changes these executives are making in three areas:  technology, people, and processes.  Technology: Make sure required controls are   in place As companies roll out the technologies that enable  employees to work from home and maintain  business continuity, cybersecurity teams can take  these actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks:  their discovery. Patches that protect remote  infrastructure deserve particular attention.   — Scale up multifactor authentication. Employees   working remotely should be required to use  multifactor authentication (MFA) to access  networks and critical applications. Scaling up  MFA can be challenging: the protection it will  add calls for a surge in short-term capacity.  Several practices make the rollout of MFA  more manageable. One is to prioritize users  who have elevated privileges (such as domain  and sys admins, and application developers)  and work with critical systems (for instance,  money transfers). Targeting those users in pilot  rollouts of modest scale will allow cybersecurity  teams to learn from the experience and use  that knowledge to shape more extensive  implementation plans. Cybersecurity teams can  also benefit from using MFA technologies, such  as the application gateways offered by several  cloud providers, that are already integrated with  existing processes.   — Install compensating controls for facility-  based applications migrated to remote  access. Some applications, such as bank- teller interfaces and cell-center wikis, are  available only to users working onsite at  their organizations’ facilities. To make such  facility-based applications available to remote  workers, companies must protect those apps  with special controls. For example, companies  might require employees to activate VPNs and  use MFA to reach what would otherwise be  facility-based assets while permitting them to  use MFA alone when accessing other parts of  the corporate environment.    — Accelerate patching for critical systems.  Shortening patch cycles for systems, such  as virtual private networks (VPNs), end- point protection, and cloud interfaces, that  are essential for remote working will help  companies eliminate vulnerabilities soon after    — Account for shadow IT. At many companies,  employees use so-called shadow IT systems,  which they set up and administer without formal  approval or support from the IT department.  Extended work-from-home operations will  expose such systems because business   96  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   processes that depend on shadow IT in the  office will break down once employees find  themselves unable to access those resources.  IT and security teams should be prepared to  transition, support, and protect business- critical shadow assets. They should also keep  an eye out for new shadow-IT systems that  employees use or create to ease working from  home, to compensate for in-office capabilities  they can’t access, or to get around obstacles.    — Quicken device virtualization. Cloud-based   virtualized desktop solutions can make it easier  for staff to work from home because many of  them can be implemented more quickly than  on-premises solutions. Bear in mind that the  new solutions will need strong authentication  protocols—for example, a complex password,  combined with a second authentication factor.  People: Help employees understand the risks Even with stronger technology controls, employees  working from home must still exercise good  judgment to maintain information security. The  added stress many people feel can make them  more prone to social-engineering attacks. Some  employees may notice that their behavior isn’t  monitored as it is in the office and therefore choose  to engage in practices that open them to other  threats, such as visiting malicious websites that  office networks block. Building a “human firewall”  will help ensure that employees who work from  home do their part to keep the enterprise secure.   — Communicate creatively. A high volume of   crisis-related communications can easily drown  out warnings of cybersecurity risks. Security  teams will need to use a mix of approaches to  get their messages across. These might include  setting up two-way communication channels  that let users post and review questions, report  incidents in real time, and share best practices;  posting announcements to pop-up or universal- lock screens; and encouraging the innovative use  of existing communication tools that compensate   for the loss of informal interactions in hallways,  break rooms, and other office settings.    — Focus on what to do rather than what not to   do. Telling employees not to use tools (such as  consumer web services) they believe they need  to do their jobs is counterproductive. Instead,  security teams must explain the benefits, such  as security and productivity, of using approved  messaging, file-transfer, and document- management tools to do their jobs. To further  encourage safe behavior, security teams can  promote the use of approved devices—for  example, by providing stipends to purchase  approved hardware and software.    — Increase awareness of social engineering.  COVID-19–themed phishing, vishing (voice  phishing), and smishing (text phishing)  campaigns have surged. Security teams must  prepare employees to avoid being tricked.  These teams should not only notify users that  attackers will exploit their fear, stress, and  uncertainty but also consider shifting to crisis- specific testing themes for phishing, vishing,  and smishing campaigns.   — Identify and monitor high-risk user groups.   Some users, such as those working   with personally identifiable information or  other confidential data, pose more risk   than others. High-risk users should be  identified and monitored for behavior (such   as unusual bandwidth patterns or bulk  downloads of enterprise data) that can indicate  security breaches.  Processes: Promote resilience Few business processes are designed to support  extensive work from home, so most lack the right  embedded controls. For example, an employee who  has never done high-risk remote work and hasn’t set  up a VPN might find it impossible to do so because  of the in-person VPN-initiation requirements. In  such cases, complementary security-control   Cybersecurity tactics for the coronavirus pandemic  97   Even with stronger technology controls,  employees working from home must still  exercise good judgment to maintain   information security.  processes can mitigate risks. Such security  processes include these:  means waiting until the organization resumes  business as usual.   — Supporting secure remote-working tools.   Security and IT help desks should add capacity  while exceptionally large numbers of employees  are installing and setting up basic security tools,  such as VPNs and MFA. It might be practical to  deploy security-team members temporarily at  call centers to provide added frontline support.   — Testing and adjusting IR and BC/DR   capabilities. Even with increased traffic,  validating remote communications and  collaboration tools allows companies to support  incident-response (IR) and business-continuity  (BC)/disaster-recovery (DR) plans. But  companies might have to adjust their plans to  cover scenarios relevant to the current crisis. To  find weak points in your plans, conduct a short  IR or BC/DR tabletop exercise with no one in  the office.   — Securing physical documents. In the office,  employees often have ready access to digital  document-sharing mechanisms, as well as  shredders and secure disposal bins for printed  materials. At home, where employees might lack  the same resources, sensitive information can  end up in the trash. Set norms for the retention  and destruction of physical copies, even if that    — Expand monitoring. Widening the scope  of organization-wide monitoring activities,  particularly for data and end points, is  important for two reasons. First, cyberattacks  have proliferated. Second, basic boundary- protection mechanisms, such as proxies, web  gateways, or network intrusion-detection  systems (IDS) or intrusion-prevention systems  (IPS), won’t secure users working from home,  off the enterprise network, and not connected  to a VPN. Depending on the security stack,  organizations that do not require the use of a  VPN or require it only to access a limited set  of resources may go largely unprotected. To  expand monitoring, security teams should  update security-information-and-event- management (SIEM) systems with new rule sets  and discovered hashes for novel malware. They  should also increase staffing in the security  operations center (SOC) to help compensate for  the loss of network-based security capabilities,  such as end-point protections of noncompany  assets. If network-based security capabilities  are found to be degraded, teams should expand  their IR and BC/DR plans accordingly.   — Clarify incident-response protocols. When   cybersecurity incidents take place, SOC teams   98  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   must know how to report them. Cybersecurity  leaders should build redundancy options into  response protocols so that responses don’t stall  if decision makers can’t be reached or normal  escalation pathways are interrupted because  people are working from home.   — Confirm the security of third parties. Nearly  every organization uses contractors and off- site vendors, and most integrate IT systems  and share data with both contract and  noncontract third parties, such as tax or law- enforcement authorities. When organizations  assess which controls must be extended to  employees to secure new work-from-home  protocols, they should do the same for third- party users and connections, who are likely to  be managing similar shifts in their operations  and security protocols. For example, ask  providers whether they have conducted any  remote IR or BC/DR tabletop drills and, if they  have, ask them to share the results. Should  any third parties fail to demonstrate adequate  security controls and procedures, consider  limiting or even suspending their connectivity  until they remediate their weaknesses.   — Sustain good procurement practices. Fast-  track procurement intended to close key  security gaps related to work-from-home  arrangements should follow standard due- diligence processes. The need for certain  security and IT tools may seem urgent, but  poor vendor selection or hasty deployment  could do more harm than good.  for any executive team that wants to protect  consumers from cyberbreaches during this period  of heightened vulnerability. Much as organizations  are stepping up internal protections for enterprise  networks, security teams in organizations that  manage consumer-facing networks and the  associated technologies will need to scale up  their technological capabilities and amend  processes quickly.   Technology: Ensure sufficient capacity Companies that make it possible for employees to  work from home must enable higher online network- traffic and transaction volumes by putting in place  technical building blocks such as a web-application  firewall, secure-sockets-layer (SSL) certification,  network monitoring, antidistributed denial of  service, and fraud analytics. As web-facing traffic  grows, organizations should take additional actions  to minimize cyberrisks:   — Enhance web-facing threat-intelligence  monitoring. To anticipate threats and take  preventive measures, security teams must  understand how heightened consumer traffic  changes the threat environment for web- facing enterprise activities. For example,  to find out if attackers are becoming more  interested in an organization’s web-facing  technologies, organizations can conduct  increased passive domain-name scans to  test for new malicious signatures tailored to  the enterprise domain or for the number of  adversarial scans targeting the enterprise  network, among other threats.  Supporting high levels of consumer- facing network traffic Levels of online activity that challenge the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)  of network traffic are accelerating. Whether  your organization provides connectivity, serves  consumers, or supports transactions, securing  the CIA of network activity should be a top priority    — Improve capacity management. Overextended  web-facing technologies are harder to monitor  and more susceptible to attacks. Security  teams can monitor the performance of  applications to identify suspected malware or  low-value security agents or even recommend  the removal of features (such as noncritical  functions or graphics on customer portals) that  hog network capacity.  Cybersecurity tactics for the coronavirus pandemic  99   Processes: Integrate and standardize   security activities Customers, employees, and vendors all play some  part in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of web-facing networks. Several  steps can help organizations to ensure that the  activities of these stakeholders are consistent and  well integrated:   — Help consumers solve CIA problems   themselves. For media providers, enabling  customers to access content without  interruption is essential, but increased usage  levels can jeopardize availability. Companies  may wish to offer guides to show users how to  mitigate access problems, particularly during  periods of peak use.    — Integrate fraud-prevention capabilities    with the SOC. Organizations that support   the execution of financial transactions should  consider integrating their existing fraud  analytics with SOC workflows to accelerate  the inspection and remediation of fraudulent  transactions.    — Account for increased costs. Many SOC tools   and managed-security-service providers  base charges for monitoring on usage—for  example, the volume of log records analyzed.  As usage increases with expanded network  traffic, organizations with usage-based fee  arrangements will need to account for any  corresponding increase in costs.  Securing remote-working arrangements and  sustaining the CIA of customer-facing networks  are essential to ensure the continuity of operations  during this disruptive time. The actions we describe  in this article, while not comprehensive, have helped  many organizations to overcome the security  difficulties they face and maintain their standing  with customers and other stakeholders.

Four strategic principles can help.  by Jim Boehm, James Kaplan, and Nathan Sportsman  101   The extraordinary efforts of many organizations  to protect workers and serve customers during  the COVID-19 pandemic have also increased their  exposure to cyberthreats. Large-scale adoption of  work-from-home technologies, heightened activity  on customer-facing networks, and greater use of  online services all present fresh openings, which  cyberattackers have been quick to exploit.  The overarching challenge for chief information- security officers (CISOs) and cybersecurity teams  will be protecting their institutions while enabling  operations to go on without interruption. For example,  cybersecurity teams at companies that provide  web-based services to consumers must adjust their  security programs to match scaled-up operations  while securing a massive shift to work-from-home  tools. At the same time, CISOs must make it possible  for security-team members to look after themselves  and their families during a health crisis.   Addressing these diverse and sometimes  competing needs at once won’t be easy. But recent  conversations with cybersecurity leaders suggest  that some governing principles are helping them  meet the challenge. This article recommends four  such principles: focusing on critical operating needs,  testing plans for managing security and technology  risks, monitoring for new cyberthreats, and  balancing protection with business continuity.  How the response to COVID-19 has  increased cyberrisk As organizations and people have curtailed travel  and in-person gatherings, they have shifted a great  deal of activity into the digital realm. Workers and  students are staying home, using videoconferencing  services, collaboration platforms, and other digital  tools to do business and schoolwork. In their free  time, they are going online to shop, read, chat, play,  and stream. All these behaviors put immense stress  on cybersecurity controls and operations. Several  major vulnerabilities stand out:   — Working from home has opened multiple   vectors for cyberattacks. A broad shift toward  work-from-home arrangements has amplified  long-standing cybersecurity challenges:  unsecured data transmissions by people who   aren’t using VPN software, weak enforcement  of risk-mitigating behaviors (the “human  firewall”), and physical and psychological  stressors that compel employees to bypass  controls for the sake of getting things done. The  more that homebound employees struggle to  access data and systems, the more they will  attempt to use risky work-arounds (exhibit).  Cybersecurity teams will need to secure  work-from-home systems and test and scale  VPNs and incident-response tools. In addition,  they may wish to revisit access-management  policies so that employees can connect to  critical infrastructure via personal devices or  open, internet-facing channels.   — Social-engineering ploys are on the rise. In   social-engineering gambits, attackers attempt  to gain information, money, or access to  protected systems by tricking legitimate users.  Companies have seen more malware-laced  email-phishing campaigns that borrow the  identities of health, aid, and other benevolent  organizations. Scammers posing as corporate  help-desk teams ask workers for their security  credentials using text phishing (“smishing”)  and voice phishing (“vishing”). Email fraudsters  have tried to get executives to move money to  fund vendors, operations, and virus-related- response activities.   — Cyberattackers are using websites with   weak security to deliver malware. With the  creation of new domains and websites to  spread information and resources to combat  the coronavirus, attackers are exploiting the  weak security controls on many of these sites  to spread malware via drive-by downloads. A  common approach hides readily available  malware (such as AZORult) inside coronavirus  heat maps or early-warning applications. In one  instance, a threat actor targeted a public-sector  entity by embedding malware in a pandemic- related document and disguising it as an  official communiqué from another part of the  government. Once installed, such a malicious  application steals a user’s confidential data  (for example, personal information, credit-card  information, and bitcoin-wallet keys). Some  malware applications launch ransomware   102  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Cybersecurity’s dual mission during the coronavirus crisis Exhibit 1 of 1  Exhibit Shifting to work-from-home arrangements can open multiple vectors  for cyberattacks.

A large government entity  in North America suffered from a distributed  denial-of-service attack aimed at disrupting  services and issuing misinformation to the  public. A major hospital in Europe was hit  with a cyberattack that forced it to suspend  scheduled operations, shut down its IT  network, and move acute-care patients  to another facility. And a department of a  local government had its website encrypted  by ransomware, preventing officials from  posting information for the public and keeping  employees from accessing certain files.  As the COVID-19 outbreak progresses and alters  the functioning of our socioeconomic systems,  cyberattackers will continue their efforts to   exploit our fears and our digital vulnerabilities.   To remain vigilant and effective, CISOs will need   new approaches.  How to address the challenge:   Strategic practices for chief  information-security officers While many CISOs and other executives have drawn   on their experiences with past crises to respond   to the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak,   the pandemic’s vast scale and unpredictable  duration are highly unusual. There is no playbook  that CISOs can open for guidance. Nevertheless,  the CISOs and senior cybersecurity managers we  have spoken to have found it especially helpful to  follow four practices:   — Focus. Security- and technology-risk teams   should focus on supporting only those  technology and security features, capabilities,  and service rollouts that are critical to  operations. Examples of focus areas that may  justify a surge in capacity over the coming  weeks include maintaining security operations,  mitigating risks of remote access to sensitive  data and software-development environments,  and implementing multifactor authentication  to enable employees to work from home.   Cybersecurity’s dual mission during the coronavirus crisis  103   Employees on the front line will play an  especially important role in keeping the  organization safe as normal on-premise  security measures become less relevant.  Organizations should also reiterate to  employees their safe remote-working protocols  and their procedures for threat identification  and escalation. Employees on the front line will  play an especially important role in keeping  the organization safe as normal on-premise  security measures become less relevant.   — Test. If your organization has security- or   technology-risk plans of any kind—such as  plans for incident response, business continuity,  disaster recovery, talent succession, and vendor  succession—then test them right away. If your  organization doesn’t have adequate plans in  place, create them and then test them. You must  determine whether your organization’s risk- response approach is effective and efficient.  Eliminating risk events is impossible, but you  can reduce the exacerbated risk associated  with a poor response.   — Monitor. Consider mustering all available   resources to help with monitoring, which enables  risk response and recovery to begin. Areas for  stepped-up monitoring can include remote  monitoring of collaboration tools, monitoring  networks for new and novel strains of malware,  and monitoring employees and endpoints to  catch data-related incidents before they result in  operational risk.    — Balance. Cybersecurity teams are likely  to receive a flood of urgent requests for   cybersecurity-policy exceptions that will allow  teams elsewhere in the organization to get work  done (for example, to approve the installation  of new apps and allow the use of USB drives).  While CISOs might be inclined to deny such  requests for the sake of preventing undue risk,  they must also bear in mind the importance of  maintaining business continuity during a fluid  and challenging time for their colleagues. To  support continued operations, CISOs may need  to tolerate slightly higher risk in the short term  by granting waivers or temporarily relaxing  some controls. An accommodating approach  will encourage colleagues to make intelligent  risk trade-offs. That said, CISOs shouldn’t allow  these exceptions to weaken an organization’s  risk posture permanently. If CISOs grant waivers  or relax controls, they should establish formal  evaluation and review processes and implement  time limits to force periodic reevaluation or limit  the exceptions to particular user groups.  The COVID-19 crisis is a human challenge above all  else. Everyone is juggling professional responsibilities  with important personal ones. The coming weeks  and months are likely to bring more uncertainty. By  adhering to the practices we described—focus,  test, monitor, and balance—CISOs can fulfill their  responsibilities to uphold their institutions’ security  and maintain business continuity while also meeting  their obligations to their teams.

The discussion tends  toward a Manichean guessing game: which jobs will  or won’t be replaced by machines?  In fact, as our research has begun to show, the story  is more nuanced. While automation will eliminate  very few occupations entirely in the next decade,  it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater  or lesser degree, depending on the type of work  they entail. Automation, now going beyond routine  manufacturing activities, has the potential, at least  with regard to its technical feasibility, to transform  sectors such as healthcare and finance, which  involve a substantial share of knowledge work.  These conclusions rest on our detailed analysis   of 2,000-plus work activities for more than   800 occupations. Using data from the US Bureau  of Labor Statistics and O*Net, we’ve quantified  both the amount of time spent on these activities  across the economy of the United States and the  technical feasibility of automating each of them. The  full results, forthcoming in early 2017, will include  several other countries,1 but we released some  initial findings late last year and are following up  now with additional interim results.  Last year, we showed that currently demonstrated  technologies could automate 45 percent of the  activities people are paid to perform and that about  60 percent of all occupations could see 30 percent  or more of their constituent activities automated,  again with technologies available today. In this  article, we examine the technical feasibility, using  currently demonstrated technologies, of automating  three groups of occupational activities: those that  are highly susceptible, less susceptible, and least  susceptible to automation. Within each category, we  discuss the sectors and occupations where robots  and other machines are most—and least—likely to  serve as substitutes in activities humans currently   perform. Toward the end of this article, we discuss  how evolving technologies, such as natural-language  generation, could change the outlook, as well as  some implications for senior executives who lead  increasingly automated enterprises.  Understanding automation potential In discussing automation, we refer to the potential  that a given activity could be automated by adopting  currently demonstrated technologies, that is to  say, whether or not the automation of that activity  is technically feasible.² Each whole occupation is  made up of multiple types of activities, each with  varying degrees of technical feasibility. Exhibit 1  lists seven top-level groupings of activities we have  identified. Occupations in retailing, for example,  involve activities such as collecting or processing  data, interacting with customers, and setting up  merchandise displays (which we classify as physical  movement in a predictable environment). Since  all of these constituent activities have a different  automation potential, we arrive at an overall estimate  for the sector by examining the time workers spend  on each of them during the workweek.   Technical feasibility is a necessary precondition  for automation, but not a complete predictor that  an activity will be automated. A second factor to  consider is the cost of developing and deploying  both the hardware and the software for automation.  The cost of labor and related supply-and-demand  dynamics represent a third factor: if workers are in  abundant supply and significantly less expensive  than automation, this could be a decisive argument  against it. A fourth factor to consider is the benefits  beyond labor substitution, including higher levels  of output, better quality, and fewer errors. These  are often larger than those of reducing labor costs.  Regulatory and social-acceptance issues, such as  the degree to which machines are acceptable in any  particular setting, must also be weighed. A robot may,  in theory, be able to replace some of the functions  of a nurse, for example. But for now, the prospect  that this might actually happen in a highly visible   1    For interim insights on our core findings, see Michael Chui, James Manyika, and Mehdi Miremadi, “Four fundamentals of workplace   automation,” McKinsey Quarterly, November 2015, McKinsey.com.  2     We define “currently demonstrated technologies” as those that have already exhibited the level of performance and reliability needed  to automate 1 or more of the 18 capabilities involved in carrying out work activities. In some cases, that level of performance has been  demonstrated through commercially available products, in others through research projects.

But  cashiers were still needed; in fact, their employment  grew at an average rate of more than 2 percent  between 1980 and 2013.  Even when machines do take over some human  activities in an occupation, this does not necessarily  spell the end of the jobs in that line of work. On  the contrary, their number at times increases in  occupations that have been partly automated,  because overall demand for their remaining activities  has continued to grow. For example, the large-scale  deployment of bar code scanners and associated  point-of-sale systems in the United States in the  1980s reduced labor costs per store by an estimated  4.5 percent and the cost of the groceries consumers  bought by 1.4 percent.3 It also enabled a number of   The most automatable activities  Almost one-fifth of the time spent in US workplaces  involves performing physical activities or operating  machinery in a predictable environment: workers  carry out specific actions in well-known settings  where changes are relatively easy to anticipate.  Through the adaptation and adoption of currently  available technologies, we estimate the technical  feasibility of automating such activities at 78 percent,  the highest of our seven top-level categories   (Exhibit 2). Since predictable physical activities figure  prominently in sectors such as manufacturing, food   3    Emek Basker, “Change at the checkout: Tracing the impact of a process innovation,” The Journal of Industrial Economics, June 2015, Volume   63, Number 2, pp. 339–70.   108  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit 2 It’s more technically feasible to automate predictable physical activities than  It’s more technically feasibly to automate predictable physical activities than  unpredictable ones. unpredictable ones.

In manufacturing, for example, performing  physical activities or operating machinery in a  predictable environment represents one-third  of the workers’ overall time. The activities range  from packaging products to loading materials on  production equipment to welding to maintaining  equipment. Because of the prevalence of such  predictable physical work, some 59 percent of all  manufacturing activities could be automated, given  technical considerations. The overall technical  feasibility, however, masks considerable variance.  Within manufacturing, 90 percent of what welders,  cutters, solderers, and brazers do, for example,  has the technical potential for automation, but for  customer-service representatives that feasibility  is below 30 percent. The potential varies among  companies as well. Our work with manufacturers   Manufacturing, for all its technical potential, is  only the second most readily automatable sector  in the US economy. The top spot belongs to  accommodations and food services, where almost  half of all labor time involves predictable physical  activities and the operation of machinery—including  preparing, cooking, or serving food; cleaning food- preparation areas; preparing hot and cold beverages;  and collecting dirty dishes. According to our analysis,  73 percent of the activities workers perform in food  service and accommodations have the potential for  automation, based on technical considerations.  Some of this potential is familiar. Automats, or  automated cafeterias, for example, have long been  in use. Now restaurants are testing new, more  sophisticated concepts, like self-service ordering or   Where machines can replace humans—and where they can't (yet)  109   Artificial intelligence and the future of knowledge work  A lot of what’s going on in AI is some mix of  math, statistics, and theoretical computer  science. It’s basically probabilistic  networks, with various strategies for how  you design those networks in different  layers. One of the things that has changed  radically is the extent to which math and  statistics and computer science talk to  one another. And now economics is also  talking, and sociology is talking—there’s  much more social-science interaction.  We’re going to need people who can help   develop algorithms in these application  areas, not just people who can use the  tools that somebody else develops. I’m  not a labor economist, but I am worried  that there’s going to be an incredible  demand for people who can work with new  technologies. And for the people who can’t,  maybe there aren’t nearly the same kind of  opportunities to earn a living. We know that  things are going to change radically, and  we have really no idea exactly how they’re  going to change.  Maria Klawe is a computer scientist and  the president of Harvey Mudd College.   even robotic servers. Solutions such as Momentum  Machines’ hamburger-cooking robot, which can  reportedly assemble and cook 360 burgers an  hour, could automate a number of cooking and  food-preparation activities. But while the technical  potential for automating them might be high, the  business case must take into account both the  benefits and the costs of automation, as well as the  labor-supply dynamics discussed earlier. For some  of these activities, current wage rates are among the  lowest in the United States, reflecting both the skills  required and the size of the available labor supply.  Since restaurant employees who cook earn an  average of about $10 an hour, a business case based  solely on reducing labor costs may be unconvincing.  Retailing is another sector with a high technical  potential for automation. We estimate that   53 percent of its activities are automatable, though,  as in manufacturing, much depends on the specific  occupation within the sector. Retailers can take  advantage of efficient, technology-driven stock  management and logistics, for example. Packaging  objects for shipping and stocking merchandise  are among the most frequent physical activities in  retailing, and they have a high technical potential  for automation. So do maintaining records of sales,  gathering customer or product information, and other  data-collection activities. But retailing also requires   cognitive and social skills. Advising customers which  cuts of meat or what color shoes to buy requires  judgment and emotional intelligence. We calculate  that 47 percent of a retail salesperson’s activities  have the technical potential to be automated—  far less than the 86 percent possible for the sector’s  bookkeepers, accountants, and auditing clerks.   As we noted above, however, just because an  activity can be automated doesn’t mean that it  will be—broader economic factors are at play.  Bookkeepers, accountants, and auditing clerks,  for example, require skills and training, so they are  scarcer than basic cooks. But the activities they  perform cost less to automate, requiring mostly  software and a basic computer.  Considerations such as these have led to an  observed tendency for higher rates of automation  for activities common in some middle-skill jobs—for  example, in data collection and data processing. As  automation advances in capability, jobs involving  higher skills will probably be automated at  increasingly high rates.   The heat map in Exhibit 3 highlights the wide  variation in how automation could play out, both in  individual sectors and for different types of activities  within them.⁴  4    For a deeper look across all sectors in the US economy, please see the data representations from McKinsey on automation and US jobs, on   public.tableau.com.   110  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit 3 Automation is technically feasible for many types of activities in industry  Automation is technically feasible for many types of activities in industry  sectors, but some activities can be more a(cid:9)ected than others. sectors, but some activities can be more affected than others.  50  100  Predictable  physical work³  Time spent in US occupations,  %, by sector    50 25 10 5 1  Technical feasibility, % of time spent on  activities that can be automated by adapting  currently demonstrated technology  0  Managing   others  Stakeholder interactions  Unpredictable physical work³  Data   collection  Applying  expertise²  Processing  data  Sectors¹ Accommodations and food service  Manufacturing  Agriculture  Transportation and warehousing  Retail trade  Mining  Other services  Construction  Utilities  Wholesale trade  Finance and insurance  Arts, entertainment, and recreation  Real estate  Administrative  Healthcare and social assistance  Information  Professional  Management  Educational services        Note: In practice, automation will depend on more than just technical feasibility.

Where machines can replace humans—and where they can't (yet)  111   Activities and sectors in the middle  range for automation  Across all occupations in the US economy, one-third  of the time spent in the workplace involves collecting  and processing data. Both activities have a technical  potential for automation exceeding 60 percent. Long  ago, many companies automated activities such as  administering procurement, processing payrolls,  calculating material-resource needs, generating  invoices, and using bar codes to track flows of  materials. But as technology progresses, computers  are helping to increase the scale and quality of these  activities. For example, a number of companies  now offer solutions that automate entering paper  and PDF invoices into computer systems or even  processing loan applications. And it’s not just entry- level workers or low-wage clerks who collect and  process data; people whose annual incomes exceed  $200,000 spend some 31 percent of their time doing  those things, as well.   Financial services and insurance provide one example  of this phenomenon. The world of finance relies on  professional expertise: stock traders and investment  bankers live off their wits. Yet about 50 percent of the  overall time of the workforce in finance and insurance  is devoted to collecting and processing data, where  the technical potential for automation is high.  Insurance sales agents gather customer or product  information and underwriters verify the accuracy of  records. Securities and financial sales agents prepare  sales or other contracts. Bank tellers verify the  accuracy of financial data.  Other activities in the middle range of the technical  potential for automation involve large amounts  of physical activity or the operation of machinery  in unpredictable environments. These types of  activities make up a high proportion of the work in  sectors such as farming, forestry, and construction  and can be found in many other sectors as well.   Examples include operating a crane on a construction  site, providing medical care as a first responder,  collecting trash in public areas, setting up classroom  materials and equipment, and making beds in hotel  rooms. The latter two activities are unpredictable  largely because the environment keeps changing.  Schoolchildren leave bags, books, and coats in a  seemingly random manner. Likewise, in a hotel room,  different guests throw pillows in different places, may  or may not leave clothing on their beds, and clutter up  the floor space in different ways.   These activities, requiring greater flexibility than  those in a predictable environment, are for now more  difficult to automate with currently demonstrated  technologies: their automation potential is 25 percent.  Should technology advance to handle unpredictable  environments with the same ease as predictable ones,  the potential for automation would jump to 67 percent.  Already, some activities in less predictable settings  in farming and construction (such as evaluating the  quality of crops, measuring materials, or translating  blueprints into work requirements) are more  susceptible to automation.  As a result, the financial sector has the technical  potential to automate activities taking up 43 percent  of its workers’ time. Once again, the potential is far  higher for some occupations than for others. For  example, we estimate that mortgage brokers spend  as much as 90 percent of their time processing  applications. Putting in place more sophisticated  verification processes for documents and credit  applications could reduce that proportion to just  more than 60 percent. This would free up mortgage  advisers to focus more of their time on advising clients  rather than routine processing. Both the customer   and the mortgage institution get greater value.   Activities with low technical potential  for automation The hardest activities to automate with currently  available technologies are those that involve  managing and developing people (9 percent  automation potential) or that apply expertise to  decision making, planning, or creative work   (18 percent). These activities, often characterized  as knowledge work, can be as varied as coding  software, creating menus, or writing promotional  materials. For now, computers do an excellent  job with very well-defined activities, such as  optimizing trucking routes, but humans still need   112  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   to determine the proper goals, interpret results, or  provide commonsense checks for solutions. The  importance of human interaction is evident in two  sectors that, so far, have a relatively low technical  potential for automation: healthcare and education.  Overall, healthcare has a technical potential for  automation of about 36 percent, but the potential is  lower for health professionals whose daily activities  require expertise and direct contact with patients.  For example, we estimate that less than 30 percent  of a registered nurse’s activities could be automated,  based on technical considerations alone. For dental  hygienists, that proportion drops to 13 percent.   Nonetheless, some healthcare activities, including  preparing food in hospitals and administering non- intravenous medications, could be automated if  currently demonstrated technologies were adapted.  Data collection, which also accounts for a significant  amount of working time in the sector, could become  more automated as well. Nursing assistants, for  example, spend about two-thirds of their time  collecting health information. Even some of the more  complex activities that doctors perform, such as  administering anesthesia during simple procedures  or reading radiological scans, have the technical  potential for automation.  Of all the sectors we have examined, the technical  feasibility of automation is lowest in education, at least  for now. To be sure, digital technology is transforming  the field, as can be seen from the myriad classes and  learning vehicles available online. Yet the essence of  teaching is deep expertise and complex interactions  with other people. Together, those two categories— the least automatable of the seven identified in  the first exhibit—account for about one-half of the  activities in the education sector.   Administrative assistants maintain inventory records  and personnel information. The automation of these  data-collection and processing activities may help   to reduce the growth of the administrative expenses  of education and to lower its cost without affecting  its quality.   Looking ahead  As technology develops, robotics and machine  learning will make greater inroads into activities  that today have only a low technical potential  for automation. New techniques, for example,  are enabling safer and more enhanced physical  collaboration between robots and humans in what  are now considered unpredictable environments.  These developments could enable the automation  of more activities in sectors such as construction.  Artificial intelligence can be used to design  components in engineer-heavy sectors.   One of the biggest technological breakthroughs  would come if machines were to develop an  understanding of natural language on par with  median human performance—that is, if computers  gained the ability to recognize the concepts in  everyday communication between people. In  retailing, such natural-language advances would  increase the technical potential for automation   from 53 percent of all labor time to 60 percent.  In finance and insurance, the leap would be  even greater, to 66 percent, from 43 percent. In  healthcare, too, while we don’t believe currently  demonstrated technologies could accomplish all of  the activities needed to diagnose and treat patients,  technology will become more capable over time.  Robots may not be cleaning your teeth or teaching  your children quite yet, but that doesn’t mean they  won’t in the future.   Even so, 27 percent of the activities in education— primarily those that happen outside the classroom or  on the sidelines—have the potential to be automated  with demonstrated technologies. Janitors and  cleaners, for example, clean and monitor building  premises. Cooks prepare and serve school food.   As stated at the outset, though, simply considering  the technical potential for automation is not enough  to assess how much of it will occur in particular  activities. The actual level will reflect the interplay of  the technical potential, the benefits and costs (or the  business case), the supply-and-demand dynamics    Where machines can replace humans—and where they can't (yet)  113   It is never too early to prepare for the future. To  get ready for automation’s advances tomorrow,  executives must challenge themselves to  understand the data and automation technologies  on the horizon today. But more than data and  technological savvy are required to capture value  from automation. The greater challenges are the  workforce and organizational changes that leaders  will have to put in place as automation upends  entire business processes, as well as the culture of  organizations, which must learn to view automation  as a reliable productivity lever. Senior leaders, for  their part, will need to “let go” in ways that run  counter to a century of organizational development.⁵  Understanding the activities that are most  susceptible to automation from a technical  perspective could provide a unique opportunity to  rethink how workers engage with their jobs and  how digital labor platforms can better connect  individuals, teams, and projects.⁶ It could also inspire  top managers to think about how many of their  own activities could be better and more efficiently  executed by machines, freeing up executive time  to focus on the core competencies that no robot or  algorithm can replace—as yet.  of labor, and various regulatory and social factors  related to acceptability.   Leading more automated enterprises Automation could transform the workplace for  everyone, including senior management. The rapid  evolution of technology can make harnessing  its potential and avoiding its pitfalls especially  complex. In some industries, such as retailing,  automation is already changing the nature of  competition. E-commerce players, for example,  compete with traditional retailers by using both  physical automation (such as robots in warehouses)  and the automation of knowledge work (including  algorithms that alert shoppers to items they may  want to buy). In mining, autonomous haulage  systems that transport ore inside mines more safely  and efficiently than human operators do could   also deliver a step change in productivity.  Top executives will first and foremost need to  identify where automation could transform their own  organizations and then put a plan in place to migrate   to new business processes enabled by automation.  A heat map of potential automation activities within  companies can help to guide, identify, and prioritize  the potential processes and activities that could be  transformed. As we have noted, the key question will  be where and how to unlock value, given the cost of  replacing human labor with machines. The majority of  the benefits may come not from reducing labor costs  but from raising productivity through fewer errors,  higher output, and improved quality, safety, and speed.   5    See Martin Dewhurst and Paul Willmott, “Manager and machine: The new leadership equation,” McKinsey Quarterly, September 2014,   McKinsey.com.  6    See Aaron De Smet, Susan Lund, and William Schaninger, “Organizing for the future,” McKinsey Quarterly, January 2016, McKinsey.com.

Companies  should watch out for five pitfalls.   by Jacques Bughin, Tanguy Catlin, Martin Hirt, and Paul Willmott  115   The processing power of today’s smartphones  are several thousand times greater than that of the  computers that landed a man on the moon in 1969.  These devices connect the majority of the human  population, and they’re only ten years old.¹  In that short period, smartphones have become  intertwined with our lives in countless ways. Few of  us get around without the help of ridesharing and  navigation apps such as Lyft and Waze. On vacation,  novel marine-transport apps enable us to hitch a  ride from local boat owners to reach an island. While  we’re away, we can also read our email, connect  with friends back home, check to make sure we  turned the heat down, make some changes to our  investment portfolio, and buy travel insurance for  the return trip. Maybe we’ll browse the Internet for  personalized movie recommendations or for help  choosing a birthday gift that we forgot to buy before  leaving. We also can create and continually update  a vacation photo gallery—and even make a few old- fashioned phone calls.    Then we go back to work—where the recognition  and embrace of digital is far less complete. Our work  involves advising the leaders of large organizations.  And as we look at this small device and all the digital  change and revolutionary potential within it, we feel  the urge to send every CEO we know a wake-up call.  Many think that having a few digital initiatives in the  air constitutes a digital strategy—it does not. Going  forward, digital strategy needs to be a heck of a lot  different from what they have today, or they’re not  going to make it.  We find that a surprisingly large number  underestimate the increasing momentum of  digitization, the behavioral changes and technology  driving it, and, perhaps most of all, the scale of the  disruption bearing down on them. Many companies  are still locked into strategy-development  processes that churn along on annual cycles. Only  8 percent of companies we surveyed recently  said their current business model would remain   economically viable if their industry keeps digitizing  at its current course and speed.   How can this be, at a moment when virtually every  company in the world is worried about its digital  future? In other words, why are so many digital  strategies failing? The answer has to do with the  magnitude of the disruptive economic force digital  has become and its incompatibility with traditional  economic, strategic, and operating models. This  article unpacks five issues that, in our experience,  are particularly problematic. We hope they will  awaken a sense of urgency and point toward how to  do better.   Pitfall 1: Fuzzy definitions When we talk with leaders about what they mean  by digital, some view it as the upgraded term for  what their IT function does. Others focus on digital  marketing or sales. But very few have a broad,  holistic view of what digital really means. We view  digital as the nearly instant, free, and flawless ability  to connect people, devices, and physical objects  anywhere. By 2025, some 20 billion devices will be  connected, nearly three times the world population.  Over the past two years, such devices have churned  out 90 percent of the data ever produced. Mining  this data greatly enhances the power of analytics,  which leads directly to dramatically higher levels of  automation—both of processes and, ultimately, of  decisions. All this gives birth to brand-new business  models.² Think about the opportunities that  telematics have created for the insurance industry.  Connected cars collect real-time information  about a customer’s driving behavior. The data allow  insurers to price the risk associated with a driver  automatically and more accurately, creating an  opportunity to offer direct, pay-as-you-go coverage  and bypassing today’s agents.  Lacking a clear definition of digital, companies  struggle to connect digital strategy to their  business, leaving them adrift in the fast-churning   1    Early versions of the smartphone date to the mid-1990s, but today’s powerful, multipurpose devices originated with the iPhone’s launch,    2    See Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future, New York, NY: W. W. Norton &    in 2007.  Company, 2017.  116  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   waters of digital adoption and change. What’s  happened with the smartphone over the past   ten years should haunt you—and no industry will   be immune.  Pitfall 2: Misunderstanding the  economics of digital Many of us learned a set of core economic principles  years ago and saw the power of their application  early and often in our careers. (For more on the  changing economics of digital competition, see the  infographic on pages 66–67.) This built intuition— which often clashes with the new economic realities  of digital competition. Consider these three:  Digital is destroying economic rent One of the first concepts we learned in  microeconomics was economic rent—profit earned  in excess of a company’s cost of capital. Digital  is confounding the best-laid plans to capture  surplus by creating—on average—more value for  customers than for firms. This is big and scary news  for companies and industries hoping to convert  digital forces into economic advantage. Instead,  they find digital unbundling profitable product and  service offerings, freeing customers to buy only  what they need. Digital also renders distribution  intermediaries obsolete (how healthy is your  nearest big-box store?), with limitless choice and  price transparency. And digital offerings can be  reproduced almost freely, instantly, and perfectly,  shifting value to hyperscale players while driving  marginal costs to zero and compressing prices.  Competition of this nature already has siphoned off  40 percent of incumbents’ revenue growth and 25  percent of their growth in earnings before interest  and taxes (EBIT), as they cut prices to defend  what they still have or redouble their innovation  investment in a scramble to catch up. “In-the- moment” metrics, meanwhile, can be a mirage: a  company that tracks and maintains its performance  relative to its usual competitors seems to be keeping   pace, even as overall economic performance  deteriorates.  There are myriad examples where these dynamics  have already played out. In the travel industry,  airlines and other providers once paid travel agents  to source customers. That all changed with the  Internet, and consumers now get the same free  services that they once received from travel agents  anytime, anyplace, at the swipe of a finger—not  to mention recommendations for hotels and  destinations that bubble up from the “crowd” rather  than experts. In enterprise hardware, companies  once maintained servers, storage, application  services, and databases at physical data centers.  Cloud-service offerings from Amazon, Google, and  Microsoft, among others, have made it possible to  forgo those capital investments. Corporate buyers,  especially smaller ones, won because the scale  economies enjoyed by these giants in the cloud  mean that the all-in costs of buying storage and  computing power from them can be less than those  incurred running a data center. Some hardware  makers lost.  The lesson from these cases: Customers were the  biggest winners, and the companies that captured  the value that was left were often from a completely  different sector than the one where the original  value pool had resided. So executives need to learn  quickly how to compete, create value for customers,  and keep some for themselves in a world of  shrinking profit pools.   Digital is driving winner-takes-all economics Just as sobering as the shift of profit pools to  customers is the fact that when scale and network  effects dominate markets, economic value rises  to the top. It’s no longer distributed across the  usual (large) number of participants. (Think about  how Amazon’s market capitalization towers  above that of other retailers, or how the iPhone  regularly captures over 90 percent of smartphone  industry profits.) This means that a company whose   Why digital strategies fail  117   Insurance: Getting a better grip on consumer surplus  If you set a digital strategy without  focusing squarely on the potential for  customers to reap massive gains, you  are likely to be blindsided. Consider the  insurance sector, where digital competitors  are poised to disintermediate agents and,  at the same time, intensify competition   with lower prices and higher levels of  service. One major insurer is fighting  back by writing and marketing its own  digital policies. This entails risks, starting  with the alienation of agencies that have  traditionally distributed its products. But  the insurer strongly believes that smart   digital approaches will enable better  pricing and superior customer experience  compared with that currently received from  agents, and it sees no reason to cede this  battlefield to someone else.  strategic goal is to maintain share relative to peers  could be doomed—unless the company is already  the market leader.  A range of McKinsey research shows how these  dynamics are playing out. At the highest level, our  colleagues’ research on economic profit distribution  highlights the existence of a power curve that has  been getting steeper over the past decade or so  and is characterized by big winners and losers at  the top and bottom, respectively (see “Strategy  to beat the odds,” on page 30). Our research on  digital revenue growth, meanwhile, shows it turning  sharply negative for the bottom three quartiles of  companies, while increasing for the top quartile.  The negative effects of digital competition on a  company’s growth in earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile,  are twice as large for the bottom three-quarters of  companies as for those at the top.   A small number of winners—often in high tech  and media—are actually doing better in the digital  era than they were before. They marshal huge  volumes of customer data drawn from their scale  and network advantages. That triggers a virtuous  cycle in which information helps identify looming  threats and the best partners in defending value  chains under digital pressure. In this environment,  incumbents often find themselves snared in some   common traps. They assume market share will  remain stable, that profitable niches will remain  defendable, and that it’s possible to maintain  leadership by outgrowing traditional rivals rather  than zeroing in on the digital models that are  winning share.   This phenomenon of major industry shakeouts isn’t  new, of course. Well before digital, we saw industry  disruptions in automobiles, PC manufacturing, tires,  televisions, and penicillin. The number of producers  typically peaked, and then fell by 70 to 97 percent.³  The issue now is that digital is causing such  disruptions to happen faster and more frequently.  Digital rewards first movers and some   superfast followers In the past, when companies witnessed rising levels  of uncertainty and volatility in their industry, a  perfectly rational strategic response was to observe   for a little while, letting others incur the costs of  experimentation and then moving as the dust  settled. Such an approach represented a bet on the  company’s ability to “outexecute” competitors. In  digital scrums, though, it is first movers and very  fast followers that gain a huge advantage over their  competitors. We found that the three-year revenue  growth (of over 12 percent) for the fleetest was  nearly twice that of companies playing it safe with  average reactions to digital competition.   3    Boyan Jovanovic and Glenn M. MacDonald, “The life cycle of a competitive industry,” The Journal of Political Economy, April 1994, Volume 102,   Number 2, pp. 322–47.  118  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   John Deere: Staying ahead of the digital threats  Farming-equipment manufacturer  John Deere is responding to the potential  for digital entrants to sweep up value  as sensors, data analytics, and artificial  intelligence boost farming productivity  beyond what has been feasible previously.  That could commoditize farming “hardware”  such as tractors and harvesting equipment.  John Deere is trying to stay ahead of this  shift by creating a data-driven service   business that collects soil samples and  analyzes weather patterns to help farmers  optimize crop yields. Sensors in tractors  and other machinery provide data for  predictive maintenance; automated  sprinkler systems sync up with weather  data; and an open-software platform lets  third parties build new service apps. As the  company’s chairman and chief executive  officer, Samuel R. Allen, told shareholders   recently, “Precision agriculture may evolve  to a point that farmers will be able to  monitor, manage, and measure the status  of virtually every plant in the field.”  Although still in the early days, the  company’s moves position it to lead in the  new business of data-enabled agriculture  while differentiating its traditional products   and services.  Why is that? First movers and the fastest followers  develop a learning advantage. They relentlessly  test and learn, launch early prototypes, and  refine results in real time—cutting down the  development time in some sectors from several  months to a few days. They also scale up platforms  and generate information networks powered by  artificial intelligence at a pace that far outstrips the  capabilities of lower-pulsed organizations. As a  result, they are often pushing ahead on version 3.0  or 4.0 offerings before followers have launched their  “me too” version 1.0 models. Early movers embed  information across their business model, particularly  in information-intensive functions such as R&D,  marketing and sales, and internal operations. They  benefit, too, from word of mouth from early adopters.  In short, first movers gain an advantage because  they can skate to where the puck is headed.    How Tesla captured first-mover value in electric  vehicles offers a lesson in the discomfiting  effects of a wait-and-see posture. Four years ago,  incumbent automakers could have purchased  Tesla for about $4 billion. No one made the move,  and Tesla sped ahead. Since then, companies  have poured money into their own electric-vehicle  efforts in a dash to compete with Tesla’s lead in   key dimensions. Over the past two years alone,  competitors have spent more than $20 billion on  sensor technologies and R&D.    Pitfall 3: Overlooking ecosystems Understanding the new economic rules will  move you ahead, but only so far. Digital means  that strategies developed solely in the context  of a company’s industry are likely to face severe  challenges. Traditional approaches such as tracking  rivals’ moves closely and using that knowledge to  fine-tune overall direction or optimize value chains  are increasingly perilous.   Industries will soon be ecosystems Platforms that allow digital players to move easily  across industry and sector borders are destroying  the traditional model with its familiar lines of sight.  Grocery stores in the United States, for example,  now need to aim their strategies toward the moves  of Amazon’s platform, not just the chain down the  street, thanks to the Whole Foods acquisition. Apple  Pay and other platform-cum-banks are entering  the competitive set of financial institutions. In  China, Tencent and Alibaba are expanding their  ecosystems. They are now platform enterprises   Why digital strategies fail  119   Don’t underestimate how digital disrupts the  nature of competition.

This has helped it to learn  and apply digital and other technology  advances at a faster pace than that of  some competitors that have stayed with  traditional cycle times. “All aspects of our  products—whether design, handling, or  everyday usage—will be modeled more  closely than ever before on the customer’s  needs,” Klaus Fröhlich, BMW’s board of   management member responsible for  development, noted recently.  Moving fast sometimes necessitates  competing with oneself. Anticipating  increased cost pressures and a faster  competitive landscape as the pace  of digitization in travel and tourism  progressed, Qantas Airways launched its  stand-alone lower-fare Jetstar. Intensive  use of digital technology in booking,  app-based loyalty programs, automated  check-in, and baggage service, as well as   digitization in other service and operations  arenas, prompted the creation of the  Jetstar brand, which is differentiated  by lower fares and a better customer  experience.   To speed up its response time and disrupt  (rather than follow) the industry, Qantas  was open to cannibalizing its flagship  brand. Today, Jetstar’s margins on its  earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)  exceed those of the Qantas brand.  that link traditional and digital companies (and  their suppliers) in the insurance, healthcare, real- estate, and other industries. A big benefit: they can  also aggregate millions of customers across these  industries.   How ecosystems enable improbable  combinations of attributes Can you imagine a competitor that offers the largest  level of inventory, fastest delivery time, greatest  customer experience, and lower cost, all at once?  If you think back to your MBA strategy class, the  answer would probably be no. In the textbook case,  the choice was between costlier products with   high-quality service and higher inventory levels  or cheaper products with lower service levels  and thinner inventories. Digital-platform and  -ecosystem economics upend the fundamentals  of supply and demand. In this terrain, the best  companies have the scale to reach a nearly limitless  customer base, use artificial intelligence and  other tools to engineer exquisite levels of service,  and benefit from often frictionless supply lines.  Improbable business models become a reality.  Facebook is now a major media player while (until   recently) producing no content. Uber and Airbnb sell  global mobility and lodging without owning cars or  hotels.   This will all accelerate. Our research shows that an  emerging set of digital ecosystems could account  for more than $60 trillion in revenues by 2025, or  more than 30 percent of global corporate revenues.  In a world of ecosystems, as industry boundaries  blur, strategy needs a much broader frame of  reference. CEOs need a wider lens when assessing  would-be competitors—or partners. Indeed, in an  ecosystem environment, today’s competitor may  turn out to be a partner or “frenemy.” Failure to  grasp this means that you will miss opportunities  and underplay threats.   While it’s true that not all businesses are able to  operate in nearly frictionless digital form, platforms  are fast rewiring even physical markets, thus  redefining how traditional companies need to  respond. Look around and you will see the new  digital structures collapsing industry barriers,  opening avenues for cross-functional products and  services, and mashing up previously segregated   122  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   markets and value pools. With vast scale from  placing customers at the center of their digital  activity, ecosystem leaders have captured value that  was difficult to imagine a decade ago. Seven of the  top 12 largest companies by market capitalization— Alibaba, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple,  Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent—are ecosystem  players. What’s not encouraging is how far  incumbents need to travel: our research shows that  only 3 percent of them have adopted an offensive  platform strategy.    Pitfall 4: Overindexing on the   ‘usual suspects’ Most companies worry about the threats posed  by digital natives, whose moves get most of the  attention—and the disruptive nature of their  innovative business models certainly merits some  anxiety. Excessive focus on the usual suspects is  perilous, though, because incumbents, too, are  digitizing and shaking up competitive dynamics. And  the consumer orientation of many digital leaders  makes it easy to overlook the growing importance of  digital in business-to-business (B2B) markets.   Digitizing incumbents are very dangerous Incumbents are quite capable of self-cannibalizing  and disrupting the status quo. In many industries,  especially regulated ones such as banking  or insurance, once an incumbent (really) gets  going, that’s when the wheels come off. After   all, incumbents control the lion’s share of most  markets at the outset and have brand recognition  across a large customer base. When they begin  moving with an offensive, innovative strategy, they  tip the balance. Digitization goes from being an  incremental affair to a headlong rush as incumbents  disrupt multiple reaches of the value chain. Digital  natives generally zero in on one segment.    Our research confirms this. Incumbents moving  boldly command a 20 percent share, on average,  of digitizing markets. That compares with only  5 percent for digital natives on the prowl. Using  another measure, we found that revved-up  incumbents create as much risk to the revenues  of traditional players as digital attackers do. And  it’s often incumbents’ moves that push an industry  to the tipping point. That’s when the ranks of slow  movers get exposed to life-threatening competition.     The B2B opportunity The importance of B2B digitization, and its  competitive implications, is easy to overlook  because the digital shifts under way are less  immediately obvious than those in B2C sectors  and value chains. However, B2B companies can  be just as disruptive. In the industries we studied,  more B2B companies had digitized their core  offerings and operations over the past three years  than had B2C players. Digitizing B2B players are  lowering costs and improving the reach and quality  of their offerings. The Internet of Things, combined   Intuit: Buiding an ecosystem by acquisition  Intuit began taking an ecosystem view  of its markets when a strategic review  showed that fintech start-ups had the  potential to target its customers with digital  products. The review also showed ways the  company could flex its financial power and  scale. Leadership decided to acquire new  digital assets to expand beyond its existing   small-business and tax products, in an  effort to reach digitally adept consumers  who were happy to use software apps to  help manage their money as well as to get a  reading on their overall financial health.   TurboTax (for both)—have been integrated  with one login, and the company offers  banks the ability to integrate customer  accounts with its products, allowing  customers easier access to online bill paying.   Three offerings—Mint (for consumers),  QuickBooks (for small businesses), and   Why digital strategies fail  123   Telefónica: Leveraging incumbency  After a wide-ranging strategic review,  Telefónica saw that it was vulnerable to  digital players that were offering mobile  customers lower-cost plans and more  flexible models. In an effort to meet  the challenges, the company launched   an independent “brownfield” start-up,  giffgaff. Its hallmark was an online-first  model for customer support that uses  community-based digital forums to resolve  customer queries. Incumbency offered an  important advantage: one of the company’s   key assets was its O2 digital network,  which provided resources and technical  capabilities in support of giffgaff’s  innovative business model.    with advanced analytics, enables leading-edge  manufacturers to predict the maintenance needs  of capital goods, extending their life and creating  a new runway for industrial productivity. Robotic  process automation (RPA) has quietly digitized   50 to 80 percent of back-office operations in some  industries. Artificial intelligence and augmented  reality are beginning to raise manufacturing yields  and quality. Meanwhile, blockchain’s digitized  verification of transactions promises to revolutionize  complex and paper-intensive processes, with  successful applications already cropping up in smart  grids and financial trading. Should the opportunities  associated with shifts like these be inspirational for  incumbents? Threatening? The answer is both.   massive and rapid disruption, bold moves across  the board are imperative to stay alive. Retail and  media industries find themselves in this quadrant.  Others are experiencing variations in the speed  and scale of disruption; to respond to the ebbs  and flows, those companies need to develop a  better field of vision for threats and a capacity for  more agile action. Keep in mind that transforming  the core leads to much lower costs and greater  customer satisfaction for existing products and  services (for example, when digitization shrinks  mortgage approvals from weeks to days), thus  magnifying the impact of incumbents’ strategic  advantages in people, brand, and existing  customers and their scale over attackers.  Pitfall 5: Missing the duality of digital The most common response to digital threats  we encounter is the following: “If I’m going to  be disrupted, then I need to create something  completely new.” Understandably, that becomes  the driving impetus for strategy. Yet for most  companies, the pace of disruption is uneven, and  they can’t just walk away from existing businesses.  They need to digitize their current businesses   and innovate new models.  Think of a basic two-by-two matrix such as the  exhibit on the following page, which shows the  magnitude and pace of digital disruption. Where  incumbents fall in the matrix determines how they  calibrate their dual response. For those facing   Beyond this dual mission, companies face another  set of choices that seems binary at first. As we have  indicated, the competitive cost of moving too slowly  puts a high priority on setting an aggressive digital  agenda. Yet senior leaders tell us that their ability  to execute their strategy—amid a welter of cultural  cross-currents—is what they worry about most. So  they struggle over where to place their energies— placing game-changing bets or remaking the place.  The fact is that strategy and execution can no longer  be tackled separately or compartmentalized. The  pressures of digital mean that you need to adapt  both simultaneously and iteratively to succeed.   Needless to say, the organizational implications  are profound. Start with people. Our colleagues  estimate that half the tasks performed by today’s   124  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit Since the extent and speed of disruption varies, companies will need to  Since the extent and speed of disruption varies, companies will need to  calibrate their response. calibrate their response.  Live in two worlds These companies need to  prepare themselves for big  changes but cannot lose focus  on their existing businesses in  the short term.

Build agility These companies need to  make rapid moves but  cannot let the scope of these  changes overshadow existing  businesses.  Pace of change  full-time workforce may ultimately become obsolete  as digital competition intensifies.⁴ New skills in  analytics, design, and technology must be acquired  to step up the speed and scale of change. Also  needed are new roles such as a more diverse set of  digital product owners and agile-implementation  guides. And a central organizational question  remains: whether to separate efforts to digitize core  operations from the perhaps more creative realm of  digital innovation.  While the details of getting this balance right will  vary by company, two broad principles apply:    — Bold aspiration. The first-mover and winner-  takes-all dynamics we described earlier  demand big investments in where to play  and often major changes to business models.  Our latest research shows that the boldest   companies, those we call digital reinventors,  play well beyond the margins. They invest at  much higher levels in technology, are more likely  to make digitally related acquisitions, and are  much more aggressive at investing in business- model innovation. This inspired boldness also  turns out to be a big performance differentiator.    — Highly adaptive. Opportunities to move  boldly often arise as a result of changing  circumstances and require a willingness to pivot.  The watchwords are failing fast and often and  innovating even faster—in other words, learning  from mistakes. Together they allow a nuanced  sensing of market direction, rapid reaction,   and a more unified approach to implementation.  Adaptive players flesh out initial ideas through  pilots. Minimum viable products trump overly  polished, theoretical business cases. Many   4   See “What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages,” McKinsey Global Institute, November 2017, McKinsey.com.  Why digital strategies fail  125   era. Clearly, though, that’s just the starting point, so  we will leave you with four elements that could help  frame the strategy effort you will need to address  the hard truths we had laid out here.   First there’s the who. The breadth of digital means  that strategy exercises today need to involve the  entire management team, not just the head of  strategy. The pace of change requires new, hard  thinking on when to set direction. Annual strategy  reviews need to be compressed to a quarterly  time frame, with real-time refinements and  sprints to respond to triggering events. Ever more  complex competitive, customer, and stakeholder  environments mean that the what of strategy needs  updating to include role playing, scenario-planning  exercises, and war games. Traditional frameworks  such as Porter’s Five Forces will no longer suffice.  Finally, the importance of strategic agility means  that, now more than ever, the “soft stuff” will  determine the how of strategy. This will enable the  organization to sense strategic opportunities in real  time and to be prepared to pivot as it tests, learns,  and adapts.  companies, however, have trouble freeing  themselves from the mindsets that take root in  operational silos. This hinders risk taking and  makes bold action difficult. It also diminishes the  vital contextual awareness needed to gauge how  close a market is to a competitive break point and  what the disruption will mean to core businesses.    As digital disruption accelerates, we often hear  a sense of urgency among executives—but it  rarely reaches the level of specificity needed to  address the disconnects we’ve described in the  five aforementioned pitfalls. Leaders are far more  likely to describe initiatives—“taking our business  to the cloud” or “leveraging the Internet of Things”— than they are to face the new realities of digital  competition head-on: “I need to develop a strategy  to become number one, and I need to get there very  quickly by creating enormous value to customers,  redefining my role in an ecosystem, and offering new  business-value propositions while driving significant  improvement in my existing business.”  Such recognition of the challenge is a first step for  leaders. The next one is to develop a digital strategy  that responds. While that’s a topic for a separate  article, we hope it’s clear, from our description of  the reasons many digital strategies are struggling  today, that the pillars of strategy (where and how  to compete) remain the cornerstones in the digital   Jacques Bughin is a director of the McKinsey Global Institute and a senior partner in McKinsey’s Brussels office,   Tanguy Catlin is a senior partner in the Boston office, Martin Hirt is a senior partner in the Greater China office, and   Paul Willmott is a senior partner in the London office.

Companies can determine whether they should invest in blockchain by focusing  on specific use cases and their market position.  by Brant Carson, Giulio Romanelli, Patricia Walsh, and Askhat Zhumaev  127   Speculation on the value of blockchain is rife, with  Bitcoin—the first and most infamous application of  blockchain—grabbing headlines for its rocketing  price and volatility. That the focus of blockchain is  wrapped up with Bitcoin is not surprising given that  its market value surged from less than $20 billion  to more than $200 billion over the course of 2017.1  Yet Bitcoin is only the first application of blockchain  technology that has captured the attention of  government and industry.   Blockchain was a priority topic at Davos; a World  Economic Forum survey suggested that 10 percent  of global GDP will be stored on blockchain by 2027.2  Multiple governments have published reports on the  potential implications of blockchain, and the past  two years alone have seen more than half a million  new publications on and 3.7 million Google search  results for blockchain.  Most tellingly, large investments in blockchain  are being made. Venture-capital funding for  blockchain start-ups consistently grew and were  up to $1 billion in 2017.3 The blockchain-specific  investment model of initial coin offerings (ICOs),  the sale of cryptocurrency tokens in a new venture,  has skyrocketed to $5 billion. Leading technology  players are also heavily investing in blockchain: IBM  has more than 1,000 staff and $200 million invested  in the blockchain-powered Internet of Things (IoT).4  Despite the hype, blockchain is still an immature  technology, with a market that is still nascent and a  clear recipe for success that has not yet emerged.  Unstructured experimentation of blockchain  solutions without strategic evaluation of the value  at stake or the feasibility of capturing it means  that many companies will not see a return on their  investments. With this in mind, how can companies  determine if there is strategic value in blockchain  that justifies major investments?   Our research seeks to answer this question by  evaluating not only the strategic importance of  blockchain to major industries but also who can   capture what type of value through what type of  approach. In-depth, industry-by-industry analysis  combined with expert and company interviews  revealed more than 90 discrete use cases of varying  maturity for blockchain across major industries.  We evaluated and stress tested the impact and  feasibility of each of these use cases to understand  better blockchain’s overall strategic value and how  to capture it.  Our analysis suggests the following three key  insights on the strategic value of blockchain:    — Blockchain does not have to be a disintermediator   to generate value, a fact that encourages  permissioned commercial applications.    — Blockchain’s short-term value will be   predominantly in reducing cost before creating  transformative business models.   — Blockchain is still three to five years away from   feasibility at scale, primarily because of the  difficulty of resolving the “coopetition” paradox  to establish common standards.   Companies should take the following structured  approach in their blockchain strategies:  1.   Identify value by pragmatically and skeptically  assessing impact and feasibility at a granular  level and focusing on addressing true pain points  with specific use cases within select industries.  2.  Capture value by tailoring strategic approaches   to blockchain to their market position, with  consideration of measures such as ability to  shape the ecosystem, establish standards, and  address regulatory barriers.  With the right strategic approach, companies can  start extracting value in the short term. Dominant  players who can establish their blockchains as the  market solutions should make big bets now.  1     Cryptocurrency market value is subject to high variation due to the specific volatility of the market. 2     Deep shift: Technology tipping points and societal impact, World Economic Forum, September 2015, weforum.org.  3   “Blockchain startups absorbed 5X more capital via ICOs than equity financings in 2017,” CB Insights, January 2018, cbinsights.com. 4   “IBM invests to lead global Internet of Things market–shows accelerated client adoption,” IBM, October 2016, ibm.com.  128  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   The nuts and bolts of blockchain With all the hype around blockchain, it can be hard  to nail down the facts (Exhibit 1). Blockchain is a  distributed ledger, or database, shared across a  public or private computing network. Each computer  node in the network holds a copy of the ledger,  so there is no single point of failure. Every piece  of information is mathematically encrypted and  added as a new “block” to the chain of historical  records. Various consensus protocols are used to  validate a new block with other participants before  it can be added to the chain. This prevents fraud  or double spending without requiring a central  authority. The ledger can also be programmed with  “smart contracts,” a set of conditions recorded on  the blockchain, so that transactions automatically  trigger when the conditions are met. For example,   smart contracts could be used to automate  insurance-claim payouts.  Blockchain’s core advantages are decentralization,  cryptographic security, transparency, and  immutability. It allows information to be verified and  value to be exchanged without having to rely on  a third-party authority. Rather than there being a  singular form of blockchain, the technology can be  configured in multiple ways to meet the objectives and  commercial requirements of a particular use case.   To bring some clarity to the variety of blockchain  applications, we structured blockchain use cases  into six categories across its two fundamental  functions—record keeping and transacting (Exhibit  2). Some industries have applications across   Exhibit 1 Five common blockchain myths create misconceptions about the advantages  Five common blockchain myths create misconceptions about the advantages  and limitations of technology. and limitations of the technology.  1  2  3  4   5   Myth Blockchain is Bitcoin  Reality Bitcoin is just one cryptocurrency application of blockchain Blockchain technology can be used and con(cid:9)gured for many  other applications  Blockchain is better than  traditional databases  Blockchain’s advantages come with signi(cid:9)cant technical trade-o(cid:3)s that  mean traditional databases often still perform better Blockchain is particularly valuable in low-trust environments where  participants can’t trade directly or lack an intermediary  Blockchain is immutable  or tamper-proof  Blockchain data structure is append only, so data can’t be removed Blockchain could be tampered with if >50% of the network-computing  power is controlled and all previous transactions are rewritten—which is  largely impractical  Blockchain is 100% secure Blockchain uses immutable data structures, such as protected   cryptography  Overall blockchain system security depends on the adjacent  applications—which have been attacked and breached  Blockchain is a “truth  machine”  Blockchain can verify all transactions and data entirely contained on  and native to blockchain (eg, Bitcoin) Blockchain cannot assess whether an external input is accurate  or “truthful”—this applies to all o(cid:3)-chain assets and data digitally  represented on blockchain  Blockchain beyond the hype: What is the strategic business value?  129   There are six distinct categories of blockchain use cases addressing two  Exhibit 2 major needs.

This framework, along with  further industry and use-case  level analysis, led to  our key insights on the nature and accessibility of  the strategic value of blockchain.  Three core insights about the strategic  value of blockchain Our analysis revealed some key takeaways   about blockchain.  Blockchain does not need to be a  disintermediator to generate value Benefits from reductions in transaction complexity  and cost, as well as improvements in transparency  and fraud controls can be captured by existing  institutions and multiparty transactions using  appropriate blockchain architecture. The economic   incentives to capture value opportunities are driving  incumbents to harness blockchain rather than be  overtaken by it. Therefore, the commercial model  that is most likely to succeed in the short term is  permissioned rather than public blockchain. Public  blockchains, like Bitcoin, have no central authority  and are regarded as enablers of total disruptive  disintermediation. Permissioned blockchains  are hosted on private computing networks, with  controlled access and editing rights (Exhibit 3).  Private, permissioned blockchain allows businesses  both large and small to start extracting commercial  value from blockchain implementations. Dominant  players can maintain their positions as central  authorities or join forces with other industry players  to capture and share value. Participants can get  the value of securely sharing data while automating  control of what is shared, with whom, and when.   130  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit 3 Most commercial blockchain will use private, permissioned architecture to  Most commercial blockchain will use private, permissioned architecture to  optimize network openness and scalability. optimize network openness and scalability.

Current use cases include the Australian Securities  Exchange, for which a blockchain system is being  deployed for equities clearing to reduce back- office reconciliation work for its member brokers.5  IBM and Maersk Line, the world’s largest shipping  company, are establishing a joint venture to bring to  market a blockchain trade platform. The platform’s  aim is to provide the users and actors involved in  global shipping transactions with a secure, real-time  exchange of supply-chain data and paperwork.6  The potential for blockchain to become a new open- standard protocol for trusted records, identity,  and transactions cannot be simply dismissed.  Blockchain technology can solve the need for an   entity to be in charge of managing, storing, and  funding a database. True peer-to-peer models can  become commercially viable due to blockchain’s  ability to compensate participants for their  contributions with “tokens” (application-specific  cryptoassets) as well as give them a stake in any  future increases in the value. However, the mentality  shift required and the commercial disruption such a  model would entail are immense.   If industry players have already adapted their  operating models to extract much of the value  from blockchain and, crucially, passed on these  benefits to their consumers, then the aperture for  radical new entrants will be small. The degree to  which incumbents adapt and integrate blockchain  technology will be the determining factor on the  scale of disintermediation in the long term.  5   “ASX selects distributed ledger technology to replace CHESS,” ASX, December 2017. 6   “Maersk and IBM to form joint venture applying blockchain to improve global trade and digitize supply chains,” IBM, January 2018, ibm.com.  Blockchain beyond the hype: What is the strategic business value?  131   In the short term, blockchain’s strategic value is  mainly in cost reduction Blockchain might have the disruptive potential to  be the basis of new operating models, but its initial  impact will be to drive operational efficiencies. Cost  can be taken out of existing processes by removing  intermediaries or the administrative effort of record  keeping and transaction reconciliation. This can   shift the flow of value by capturing lost revenues  and creating new revenues for blockchain-service  providers. Based on our quantification of the  monetary impact of the more than 90 use cases we  analyzed, we estimate approximately 70 percent  of the value at stake in the short term is in cost  reduction, followed by revenue generation and  capital relief (Exhibit 4).    Exhibit 4 The value at stake from blockchain varies across industries. The value at stake from blockchain varies across industries. Inpact of blockchain by industry  Revenue  Cost  Capital  Social  Limited  Low  Medium  High  Agriculture  Arts and recreation  Automotive  Financial services  Healthcare  Insurance  Manufacturing  Mining  Property  Public sector  Retail  Technology, media, and telecommunications Transport and logistics  Utilities  132  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Certain industries’ fundamental functions are  inherently more suited to blockchain solutions, with  the following sectors capturing the greatest value:  financial services, government, and healthcare. Financial services’ core functions of verifying and  transferring financial information and assets very  closely align with blockchain’s core transformative  impact. Major current pain points, particularly in  cross-border payments and trade finance, can  be solved by blockchain-based solutions, which  reduce the number of necessary intermediaries  and are geographically agnostic. Further savings  can be realized in capital markets post-trade  settlement and in regulatory reporting. These  value opportunities are reflected in the fact that  approximately 90 percent of major Australian,  European, and North American banks are already  experimenting or investing in blockchain.  As with banks, governments’ key record-keeping  and verifying functions can be enabled by blockchain  infrastructure to achieve large administrative savings.  Public data is often siloed as well as opaque among  government agencies and across businesses,  citizens, and watchdogs. In dealing with data from  birth certificates to taxes, blockchain-based records  and smart contracts can simplify interactions  with citizens while increasing data security. Many  public-sector applications, such as blockchain- based identity records, would serve as key enabling  solutions and standards for the wider economy.   More than 25 governments are actively running  blockchain pilots supported by start-ups.  Within healthcare, blockchain could be the key  to unlocking the value of data availability and  exchange across providers, patients, insurers, and  researchers. Blockchain-based healthcare records  can not only facilitate increased administrative  efficiency, but also give researchers access to  the historical, non–patient-identifiable data sets  crucial for advancements in medical research.  Smart contracts could give patients more control  over their data and even the ability to commercialize  data access. For example, patients could charge  pharmaceutical companies to access or use their  data in drug research. Blockchain is also being  combined with IoT sensors to ensure the integrity of   the cold chain (logistics of storage and distribution  at low temperatures) for drugs, blood, and organs.  Over time, the value of blockchain will shift from  driving cost reduction to enabling entirely new  business models and revenue streams. One of the  most promising and transformative use cases is the  creation of a distributed, secure digital identity—for  both consumer identity and the commercial know- your-customer process—and the services associated  with it. However, the new business models this would  create are a longer-term possibility due to current  feasibility constraints.  Feasibility at scale is likely to be three to five   years away The strategic value of blockchain will only be realized  if commercially viable solutions can be deployed at  scale. Our analysis evaluated each of the more than  90 potential use cases against the four key factors  that determine a use case’s feasibility in a given  industry: standards and regulations, technology,  asset, and ecosystem (Exhibit 5). While many  companies are already experimenting, meaningful  scale remains three to five years away for several  key reasons.   Common standards are essential  The lack of common standards and clear regulations  is a major limitation on blockchain applications’  ability to scale. However, where there is strong  demand and commitment, work is already under way  to resolve this issue. Standards can be established  with relative ease if there is a single dominant player  or a government agency that can mandate the legal  standing. For example, governments could make  blockchain land registries legal records.   When cooperation between multiple players is  necessary, establishing such standards becomes  more complex but also more essential. Strong  headway has already been made by industry  consortiums, as seen with the R3 consortium of more  than 70 global banks that collaborated to develop  the financial-grade open-source Corda blockchain  platform. Such platforms could establish the common  standards needed for blockchain systems.

Feasibility of blockchain by industry  Limited  Low  Medium  High  Asset  Technology  Standards and  regulations  Ecosystem  Agriculture  Arts and recreation  Automotive  Financial services  Healthcare  Insurance  Manufacturing  Mining  Property  Public sector  Retail  Technology, media, and telecommunications Transport and logistics  Utilities  134  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Globally, regulators have taken varying positions,  but most are engaged rather than opposed.  For example, the US Securities and Exchange  Commission’s recognition of ICOs as securities  brought ICOs under the agency’s regulation and into  the mainstream.7 In 2017, Standards Australia took  a leadership position in developing a road map of  priorities on behalf on the International Organization  for Standardization and helping establish common  terminology as a key first step.8 So far, many  governments are following a technologically neutral  regulatory approach—not promoting or banning  specific technologies like blockchain.   Technology must advance The relative immaturity of blockchain technology is a  limitation to its current viability. The misconception  that blockchain is not viable at scale due to its  energy consumption and transaction speed is a  conflation of Bitcoin with blockchain. In reality, the  technical configurations are a series of design  choices in which the levers on speed (size of block),  security (consensus protocol), and storage (number  of notaries) can be selected to make most use cases  commercially viable. As an example, health records  in Estonia are still in databases “off chain” (meaning  not stored on blockchain), but blockchain is used to  identify, connect, and monitor these health records  as well as who can access and alter them. These  trade-offs mean blockchain performance might be  suboptimal to traditional databases at this stage, but  the constraints are diminishing as the technology  rapidly develops.   The immaturity of blockchain technology  also increases the switching costs, which are  considerable given all the other system components.  Organizations need a trusted enterprise solution,  particularly because most cost benefits will not  be realized until old systems are decommissioned.  Currently, few start-ups have sufficient credibility  and technology stability for government or industry  deployment at scale. Major technology players    are strongly positioning themselves to address   this gap with their own blockchain as a service  (BaaS) offerings in a model similar to cloud-  based storage.  Assets must be able to be digitized  Asset type determines the feasibility of improving  record keeping or transacting via blockchain  and whether end-to-end solutions require the  integration of other technologies. The key factor  here is the digitization potential of the asset; assets  like equities, which are digitally recorded and  transacted, can be simply managed end to end on   a blockchain system or integrated through  application programming interfaces (APIs) with  existing systems.   However, connecting and securing physical goods  to a blockchain requires enabling technologies  like IoT and biometrics. This connection can be a  vulnerability in the security of a blockchain ledger  because while the blockchain record might be  immutable, the physical item or IoT sensor can  still be tampered with. For example, certifying the  chain of custody of commodities like grain or milk  would require a tagging system like radio-frequency  identification that would increase the assurance  being provided but not deliver absolute provenance.   The coopetition paradox must be resolved  The nature of the ecosystem is the fourth key  factor because it defines the critical mass required  for a use case to be feasible. Blockchain’s major  advantage is the network effect, but while the  potential benefits increase with the size of the  network, so does the coordination complexity. For  example, a blockchain solution for digital media,  licenses, and royalty payments would require a  massive amount of coordination across the various  producers and consumers of digital content.   Natural competitors need to cooperate, and it is  resolving this coopetition paradox that is proving the   7     Jay Clayton, “Statement on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, December 2017, sec.gov. 8   “Roadmap for blockchain standards,” Standards Australia, March 2017.  Blockchain beyond the hype: What is the strategic business value?  135   hardest element to solve in the path to adoption at  scale. The issue is not identifying the network—  or even getting initial buy-in—but agreeing on the  governance decisions around how the system,  data, and investment will be led and managed.  Overcoming this issue often requires a sponsor,  such as a regulator or industry body, to take the  lead. Furthermore, it is essential that the strategic  incentives of the players are aligned, a task that can  be particularly difficult in highly fragmented markets.  Critical mass is much lower in some industries and  applications than in others, while in some cases,  networks need to be established across industries  to achieve material benefits.  What strategic approach should  companies take? Our research and emerging insights suggests  following a structured approach to answer the  classic questions of blockchain business strategy.  Where to compete: Focus on specific, promising  use cases There is a plethora of use cases for blockchain;  companies face a difficult task when deciding which  opportunities to pursue. However, they can narrow  their options by taking a structured approach  through a lens of pragmatic skepticism. The first  step involves determining whether there is sufficient  accessible value at stake for a given use case.  Companies can only avoid the trap of developing  a solution without a problem by rigorously  investigating true pain points—the frictions for  customers that blockchain could eliminate.   Identification of specific pain points enables  granular analysis of the potential commercial value  within the constraints of the overall feasibility of the  blockchain solution. Overall industry characteristics  as well as a company’s expertise and capabilities will  further influence this decision, as companies need  to understand the nuances of all these components  to decide which use case will generate a solid  return on investment. If a use case does not meet  a minimum level of feasibility and potential return,   then companies do not even have to consider the  second step of which blockchain strategy to adopt.   How to compete: Optimize blockchain strategy  based on market position Once companies have identified promising use  cases, they must develop their strategies based  on consideration of their market positions relative  to their target use cases. Many of the feasibility  factors already discussed are within a business’s  sphere of influence; even technology and asset  constraints can be managed through trade-offs and  a series of design choices to shape a viable solution.  Therefore, a company’s optimal strategic approach  to blockchain will fundamentally be defined by the  following two market factors, which are those they  can least affect:    —  market dominance—the ability of a player to   influence the key parties of a use case   —  standardization and regulatory barriers—   the requirement for regulatory approvals or  coordination on standards  These two factors are critical in determining a  company’s optimal strategic approach because they  are integral to achieving the coordination required  (Exhibit 6). Blockchain’s value comes from its  network effects and interoperability, and all parties  need to agree on a common standard to realize this  value—multiple siloed blockchains provide little  advantage over multiple siloed databases. As the  technology develops, a market standard will emerge,  and investments into the nondominant standard will  be wasted.    This consideration of a company’s market  position will inform which of four distinct strategic  approaches to blockchain should be deployed and,  in fact, further refine which type of use cases to  focus on first.  Leaders Leaders should act now to maintain their market  positions and take advantage of the opportunity   136  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Exhibit 6 Optimal blockchain strategy for each use case is dependent on market  Optimal blockchain strategy for each use case is dependent on market position  position and ability to in(cid:127)uence standards and regulatory barriers. and ability to influence standards and regulatory barriers.

As dominant players  pursuing use cases with fewer requirements for  coordination and regulatory approval, they can  establish market solutions.   The greatest risk for these companies is inaction,  which would cause them to lose the opportunity to  strengthen their competitive advantages compared  to competitors. An example of a leader following   this strategy is Change Healthcare, one of the   largest independent healthcare IT companies in   the United States, when it launched an enterprise- scale healthcare blockchain for claims processing  and payment.9   Conveners Conveners need to be driving the conversations and  consortiums that are shaping the new standards  that will disrupt their current businesses. Despite  being dominant players, they cannot single handedly  direct blockchain adoption as they face  greater  regulatory and standardization barriers. Instead,   they can position themselves to shape and capture  the value of new blockchain standards.   Convening tactics should be deployed for high- value use cases—like trade finance—that cannot  be realized without a broadly shared set of  standards. An example of a convener following this  strategy is Toyota, whose Research Institute set  up the Blockchain Mobility Consortium with four  global partners to focus on blockchain solutions  for critical accelerators of autonomous vehicles:  data sharing, peer-to-peer transaction, and usage- based insurance.10  Followers Followers should also carefully consider and  implement an appropriate blockchain strategy. Most  companies do not have the capability to influence  all necessary parties, especially when applications  of blockchain require high standardization or  regulatory approval. Such companies cannot be  unaware of market innovations—they should keep a   9   “ Change Healthcare announces general availability of first enterprise-scale blockchain solution for healthcare,” Change Healthcare, January   2018, changehealthcare.com.  10 “Toyota Research Institute explores blockchain technology for development of new mobility ecosystem,” Toyota, May 2017, toyota.com.  Blockchain beyond the hype: What is the strategic business value?  137   watching brief on blockchain developments and be  prepared to move fast to adopt emerging standards.  Just as businesses have developed risk and legal  frameworks for adopting cloud-based services, they  should focus on developing a strategy for how they  will implement and deploy blockchain technology.   the services into—and disrupting—industries  in which they are not currently participants.  Companies pursuing an attacker strategy often  seek partnership with a dominant company in the  market to leverage their leadership influence.  The insights from our analysis suggest that, beyond  the hype, blockchain has strategic value for  companies by enabling both cost reduction without  disintermediation as well as, in the longer term, the  creation of new business models. Existing digital  infrastructure and the growth of blockchain as a  service (BaaS) offerings have lowered the costs of  experimentation, and many companies are testing  the waters. However, fundamental feasibility factors  delimit what can be scaled and when as well as the  realistic time scales for return on investment on  proof of concepts.   Assessing these factors with pragmatic skepticism  about the scale of impact and speed to market will  reveal the correct strategic approach on where  and how to compete to enable companies to start  extracting value in the short term. Indeed, those  dominant players who can establish their blockchain  as the market solution should be making the moves— and making them now.  Followership is a particularly risky strategy for  blockchain, given the likelihood of select players  in an industry establishing private-permissioned  networks, as in freight, for example. A follower, no  matter how fast, might already be locked out of  the exclusive club that established the initial proof  of concept. Companies can mitigate this risk by  joining select existing and emerging consortia  early, when the short-term investment costs of  membership are outweighed by the long-term  costs of getting left behind.  Attackers Attackers are often new market entrants without  an existing market share to protect, so they need to  seek disruptive or transformative business models  and blockchain solutions. Attacker approaches  are suited to use cases with the highest disruptive  potential through offering a service to the market  that would disintermediate existing players. Most  peer-to-peer applications, from finance to insurance  to property, fall into this category. An example of an  attacker following this strategy is Australian start- up PowerLedger, a peer-to-peer marketplace for  renewable energy that raised 34 million Australian  dollars through its ICO.11   Incumbents should deploy an attacker blockchain  strategy in a separate noncore digital business.  Blockchain as a service (BaaS) providers often  adopt an attack strategy because they are selling   11 “Power Ledger token generation event closes with A$34million raised,” Power Ledger, October 2017, web.powerledger.io.

By acting early and being bold and decisive,  CEOs can accelerate their digital transformation and reach the next  normal sooner.  by Matt Fitzpatrick, Isha Gill, Ari Libarikian, Kate Smaje, and Rodney Zemmel  140   There’s a popular meme going around that neatly  captures the tipping point of digital. It’s a short  questionnaire asking who is driving your digital  transformation. The first two options are “CEO” and  “chief digital officer.” Below that, highlighted with a  bright red circle, is “COVID-19.”  The coronavirus pandemic is a humanitarian crisis  that continues to take a tragic toll on people’s  lives.  There’s no denying it is also acting as a catalyst  for change—economic, societal, personal, and  corporate—on a scale not seen since wartime. The  scale of the change and the speed at which it’s  happening is shining a bright light on the fact that  companies are facing a once-in-a-generation shift.  And for all the uncertainty about what the future will  look like, it’s clear already that it will be digital.  The challenging economic outlook and continued  uncertainty are forcing CEOs to contemplate  some difficult choices. Some are pulling in, making  cuts, and focusing on riding out the storm. Others,   however, are taking decisive action to make sure  that when the crisis ends, they’ll be stronger than  they are today.  Research and experience show that those acting  with a through-cycle mindset will be best positioned  to accelerate out of the downturn. In the recessions  of 2007–08, the top quintile of companies was  ahead of their peers by about 20 percentage points as they moved into the recovery in terms of  cumulative total returns to shareholders (TRS). Eight years later, their lead had grown to more than  150 percentage points.¹ One key lesson from that  experience is the companies that move early and  decisively in a crisis do best.  Accelerating your digital  transformation We believe the COVID-19 crisis is likely to  significantly accelerate the shift to digital and  fundamentally shake up the business landscape.  Even before COVID-19 hit, 92 percent of companies   1 Martin Hirt, Kevin Laczkowski, and Mihir Mysore, “Bubbles pop, downturns stop,” McKinsey Quarterly, May 2019, McKinsey.com.  Core principles  As CEOs consider how to move ahead, certain mindsets and capabilities matter more than others. They were important before  COVID-19 hit but are particularly crucial today:  —   Flexibility and speed. The speed at which the change hit us caught everyone off guard. It’s become obvious that entrenched   systems that have supported businesses for years—tech stacks, reporting lines, processes—have been no match for the  dynamic fluidity of the current crisis. Building in redundancies, modularized systems for quick switch-outs, and devolved  decision making (based on clear guidelines) will need to be the norm.  —   Bold actions backed by a solid understanding of risk. The scale of the crisis needs to be matched by boldness in response.  Incremental change and half measures are unlikely to provide businesses with the economic horsepower needed to ride out  the storm and come out of the crisis in a strong position. Boldness of action should be tempered with a full appreciation of risk,  from the impact of cyberattacks to the loss of crucial talent.  —   Commitment to a holistic approach. The crisis has highlighted systemic and organizational weaknesses. These flaws highlight  the need to ensure that digital initiatives take into account the complete range of dependencies and build in cross- functional  mechanisms that integrate systems, people, and processes across the business.  The digital-led recovery from COVID-19: Five questions for CEOs  141   thought their business models would need to  change given digitization.² The companies listed on  the S&P 500 Index have an average age of 22 years,  down from 61 years in 1958.³  Despite herculean efforts and significant  accomplishments at many businesses, the  pandemic has brought into sharp relief how  vulnerable companies really are. One consumer-  packaged-goods (CPG) company saw its online  orders go through the roof, only to have its  operations descend into chaos in an effort to  process and fulfill the surge. Tech-enabled  businesses, on the other hand, were able to move  at speed, such as India food-tech business Zomato,  which used its platform to work with grocery start- ups to meet surging online-order demand.⁴  For many companies, the only option is to accelerate  their digital transformation. That means moving from  active experimentation to active scale-up supported  by ongoing testing and continuous improvement.  These moves should happen across two dimensions:  at the core of the company and through the  development of new businesses. Top-performing  digital companies take this twin approach.⁵  Despite the immense challenges CEOs are  managing today, now is the time to act. In fact, we’ve  seen that the reduction in time spent traveling  has given CEOs and their top teams more time  to focus on new initiatives. One leader at a large  bank, for instance, said recently that it was finally  getting around to launching an important customer- relationship-management (CRM) program that it  had no time for before. Given how fast change is  happening, waiting until you see signs of recovery  will be too late.    There is much we don’t know. But drawing on our  experience and lessons learned from companies  that are moving ahead—particularly in China—  we believe that CEOs should ask the following  questions to help prepare their businesses for the  recovery when it finally comes.  1. Do you have a clear view of where the value  is going to be and a road map that will get you  there? Despite noteworthy successes in adjusting to  COVID-19, many leaders have been frustrated by  how slowly necessary changes have moved, from  serving a surge of customers migrating to digital  channels to scaling back-end operations. We  believe that one of the biggest reasons for these  difficulties is that, while companies have had many  digital pilots and initiatives in place, they didn’t add  up to a coherent and integrated digital engine to  drive the business forward.  Accelerating their digital transformation requires  CEOs to take a step back and reassess their road  maps (the coordinated and detailed plans for what  needs to be done, by whom and when, from the  leadership level down to the front line) as well  as the assumptions about value and feasibility  underlying them. Those assumptions need to  be based on emerging new customer behaviors,  supplier dynamics, and regulation. Our consumer- sentiment analysis, for example, has revealed whole  new consumer groups trying out digital products  and services for the first time. As of this writing, in  the United States, some 35 percent of Gen Zers,  for example, have used video chat for the first time  (versus just 6 percent for boomers), while 54 percent  of households with incomes greater than $100,000  have tried online streaming for the first time (versus  35 percent of those households earning less than  $50,000).⁶  2 Jacques Bughin, Tanguy Catlin, Martin Hirt, and Paul Willmott, “Why digital strategies fail,” McKinsey Quarterly, January 2018, McKinsey.com. 3  Matt Banholzer, Markus Berger-de Leon, Ralf Dreischmeier, Ari Libarikian, and Erik Roth, “Building new businesses: How incumbents use their  advantages to accelerate growth,” December 2019, McKinsey.com. 4 Pramugdha Mamgain, “India’s Zomato sees business opportunity in grocery amid COVID-19 crisis,” Deal Street Asia, March 23, 2020,  dealstreetasia.com. 5 “How digital reinventors are pulling away from the pack,” October 2017, McKinsey.com. 6 “Survey: US consumer sentiment during the coronavirus crisis,” April 2020, McKinsey.com.  142  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   On the B2B side, our recent customer-behavior  research shows that digital interaction with B2B  customers is now two times more important  than traditional channels—more than a 30  percent jump since before the COVID-19 crisis  hit.⁷ In telemedicine, regulation, licensing, and  reimbursement questions that had traditionally  hampered its adoption have been swept away to  help fight the coronavirus, laying open a scenario  of reduced—or, at least, different—regulation in  the next normal. These developments have to be  closely monitored, of course. Some behaviors are  likely to stick—early research suggests that more  than 55 percent of Chinese consumers are likely  to permanently buy more groceries online, for  example⁸—while others won’t.  Having a road map doesn’t mean, of course, that  it will be executed. Among the most important  tasks in operationalizing the road map is getting  alignment with the leadership team—the chief  digital officer (CDO) as well as key line and  functional leaders—and putting in place the  resources needed to deliver on it. Alignment is  challenging in normal times but is now that much  more difficult with your leadership team all working  from home. Through video chat or phone, the  CEO needs to be explicit in calling out members  of the top team so that everyone understands  not only what the road map is but also what their  responsibilities are and how they will be resourced.  CEOs should then work with their top team to  identify critical roles (roughly 30 to 40 for an   enterprise). For these roles, it’s important to spell  out the job and eliminate tasks that are not essential,  and then provide solid teams, enough budget, and  clear (usually enhanced) decision rights. Selection is  critical—you need absolutely the best talent in these  roles.  2. What role should business building have in  helping you accelerate your entrance into new  markets or access new customers? Many businesses can only match the pace of both  the crisis and the change in customer behavior by  building something outside of the core company.  This allows them to build something in a modern  way—fully agile with microservice architecture and  entrepreneurial talent.  The issue, however, is that fewer than 10 percent  of business builds succeed. When enterprises  take a more structured approach—including a  clear strategy, entrepreneurial talent, and the  proper balance between corporate support and  operational freedom—the success rate jumps  to 67 percent. Corporate support is particularly  important now. Besides access to cash and   relative stability, large enterprises provide a “safe harbor” during the crisis, allowing the  entrepreneurial spirit to thrive free from the  broader economic concerns. Our recent B2B  survey indicates that large B2B companies remain  more stable, with approximately 50 percent  planning to increase or maintain their spending in  the short and long term.⁹  7 McKinsey B2B Decision Maker Pulse Survey. 8 Julien Boudet, Jonathan Gordon, Brian Gregg, Jesko Perrey, and Kelsey Robinson, “How marketing leaders can both manage the coronavirus  crisis and plan for the future,” April 2020, McKinsey.com. 9 McKinsey B2B Decision Maker Pulse Survey.  Executive checklist   — Do you have a business-led technology road map that reflects new assumptions about your industry and the pace of digital adoption   by your customers, suppliers, employees, and regulators?   — Does your resourcing—including where your very best talent is deployed—match your digital aspirations?   — Does your road map reflect the “last-mile behavior changes” that will be necessary to make your transformation program stick?  The digital-led recovery from COVID-19: Five questions for CEOs  143   We have already seen and, frankly, been deeply  inspired by, what is possible during this current  coronavirus crisis. In China, engineers built two  hospitals (2,600 beds in total) from scratch in just  over a week. In select catchment areas, the National  Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom was  able to execute long-term telehealth plans in   15 days or fewer. What this demonstrates to us—as  in the proverbial “necessity being the mother of  invention”—is that people can move with astonishing  speed to build something new. One European  retailer was able to launch a new e-commerce  business in just 13 weeks. Overturning assumptions  about the  way organizations and consumers  operate, we see a number of early archetypes  for postcrisis business builders. Remote-service  providers, for example, can take advantage of the  big shift to online access by delivering services and  providing support. Data visionaries are finding  ways through analytics and automation to use new  types and sources of data to generate value.  CEOs will have a key role in making sure that the  enterprise develops a business-building capability  rather than simply launching a new business. That’s  because it will be necessary to launch multiple  businesses over time to sustain new sources of  growth and as a hedge against future uncertainties.  3. How can you lock in the benefits of a more agile  operating model to increase the metabolic rate  of your business? Once an almost exclusive domain of IT, agile has  now permeated almost every part of the business.  Companies are being forced to move and take  action at unprecedented speed—and almost  exclusively remotely. A large bank, for example was   faced with a 20-fold rise in origination volumes as  part of a loan program to support small businesses.  It “stood up” a cross-functional executive team to  tackle the issue, from customer communication  to underwriting to product development and  training for 500-plus employees. The bank did  this via twice-daily agile huddles, rapid backlog  management, and issue resolution, all in a fully  virtual setting.  The nature of the crisis has required teams to act  quickly amidst uncertainty, make decisions with limited oversight, and react to fast-changing  situations. There are typically 50 people that make  80 percent of the decisions, but, as the crisis has shown, moving to agile allows you to take  advantage of thousands of brains.  Some new ways of working are an “all hands on  deck” response to the pandemic that are not likely  to be sustainable. But as CEOs look to accelerate  the metabolic rate of their business in preparation  for the recovery, they will need to be deliberate in  protecting what has worked well and guard against  the legacy ways of working creeping back when   the crisis abates. Centralization can be good for  managing a crisis, but it should not be mistaken for  a model for growth, and CEOs will need to keep any  overly centralized action from being the status quo.  Protecting the benefits of new ways of working  also doesn’t mean just cutting costs on travel. It’s  about harnessing the vitality and effectiveness of  extended agile teams working on objectives, not  simply tasks.  For one thing, we suspect that executives are  realizing something that we ourselves are also   Executive checklist   — How are you balancing the advantages the large enterprise can provide with the freedom that the new business needs to thrive?   — How will the management team measure success—including incorporating the high volumes of customer feedback—of the new   business at the three-, six-, and 12-month mark from launch?   — What external partnerships are you exploring to build and scale the new business?  144  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   seeing: videoconferencing can be much more  productive, especially for quick check-ins. While  in-person meetings will be needed—previous  research has shown that productivity among  teams drops as the number of locations they  work from increases—some hybrid models will  likely emerge to take advantage of the benefits of  remote and in-person connection. Video meetings  have exposed what agile gurus have been saying  for years: that the ideal effective team size is  five to nine people. A 20-person virtual meeting,  where you can see only nine people on an iPad  screen, has shown itself to often be an exercise in  frustration. Many CEOs should be able to see how  much a skeleton crew can get done when given the  right tools, support, and mission.  Other benefits are emerging as well, ones that CEOs  need to make sure stick. For one, it will be crucial  to preserve the empowered and iterative ways of  working. Another is that clarity of purpose and a  tight focus on just a few things can do wonders for  animating an organization and driving results.  The necessity to figure out things on the fly has  underscored another crucial capability: being able  to learn and adapt. Even before the crisis, we found  that the top 10 percent of companies in terms of  revenue growth are more than 50 percent more  effective than peers in testing, measuring, and  executing based on what they’ve learned. Building  up this corporate muscle isn’t about improving  training (although that is important, more on that later); it’s about embedding a culture of experimentation, learning, and iterating.  The words of Beth Galetti, the senior vice president  of HR at Amazon, are instructive: “We are  frequently doing things that have never been done  before. For this reason, there is often no playbook  to teach nor experts to follow, so we empower  people to try new things and learn along the way.”10  The CEO can start building support for agile now  by calling attention to the ways in which work has  improved as well as by identifying processes and  incentives that can hardwire the benefits.  4. How should you rethink your talent strategy  so that you have the people you need when the  recovery starts? As the full economic impact of the crisis hits,  pressure will continue to build to cut costs. CEOs  will be faced with difficult people decisions. However, given the importance of talent in  accelerating progress, it’s critical to adopt a  through-cycle mindset on people—not just in  keeping the right talent but also in building the  skills of the people you already have. For CEOs,  this means developing a talent road map that’s as  detailed as a technology one.  CEOs at several large businesses are acting on this  through-cycle mentality by articulating what critical  skill pools are needed for recovery. In the technology  realm, for example, the focus should be on building  your base of top engineers, who are ten times more  productive than less accomplished developers.  These are the people who will be rapidly deployed  and redeployed to do the most important work.  This exercise includes determining how many of  them will be needed so that there is sufficient   10 “How Amazon is built to try and learn,” February 2020, McKinsey.com.  Executive checklist   — Are your business leaders, technologists, and control functions working together to continuously deliver incremental improvements   (every two weeks) grounded in customer value?   — What does “test and learn” look like week to week for each of your strategic initiatives, so that you can capture learning from failure   and build on it?   — Have you identified which elements of your current way of working you want to preserve and created a plan for doing so?  The digital-led recovery from COVID-19: Five questions for CEOs  145   resiliency, developing an approach to building  their skills, and identifying both the people who  have emerged as stars during the crisis and those  whose skills can be upgraded through training.  Training itself is likely to see profound change.  Before COVID-19 hit, most companies struggled  to get online learning to work. The new world of  remote working, however, is acclimatizing people  to the tools and processes that are core to distance  education. This represents an opportunity for  training to scale the programs built for how people actually learn best: shorter, “bite size” learning  modules tailored to the individual and delivered  when they’re needed as part of a thoughtful  learning journey. CEOs should prioritize remote  boot camps, self-serve modules, simulations, and  collaborative learning environments supplemented  by a rigorous certification program and in-field  trials to accelerate how teams learn.  5. What investments are the most necessary to  create the technology environment that will allow  your company to thrive in the next normal? The disruptions of the coronavirus have  underscored the crucial role of technology, from  supporting remote working to scaling digital  channels for surging customers. Despite the  outstanding accomplishments in managing the  technology response to the crisis, the many  setbacks have highlighted systemic weaknesses.  That shouldn’t be a huge surprise, since of the  organizations that have pursued digitization, 79 percent are still in the early stages of their  technology transformation.11 More important,   they’ve highlighted a point that’s been made before  but can no longer be ignored: technology is a core  driver of value, not merely a support function.  This insight is crucial because too often the  overriding factor when it comes to technology has  been cost. CEOs have a leading role to play now in  expanding that definition to include value creation  as well as flexibility, cybersecurity, and resiliency.  To make that happen, CEOs will need to work much  more directly with their chief information officers  (CIOs) or chief technology officers (CTOs) to make  tech investments in legacy-system modernization  and in microservice-architecture development,  or in building a new tech stack altogether (for  instance, for developing a new business). To enable  this kind of effective decision making, some CEOs  have added CIOs to the leadership team and have  asked them to report directly. Having   CIOs closely involved with shaping the business  strategy and agenda is shown to enable faster  progress in achieving a company’s digital goals.12  That focus on value extends to data and advanced  analytics as well. Never before has the need for accurate and timely data been greater. The  government of South Korea proved that point  when it worked with private companies to launch  a COVID-19 data platform that reduced contact-  tracing time from 24 hours in early February to  less than ten minutes on March 26. To do so,  they developed a  digital surveillance system  that consolidates information from 27 public and  private organizations.13 This example highlights the   11 “Can IT rise to the digital challenge?,” October 2018, McKinsey.com. 12 “Can IT rise to the digital challenge?,” October 2018, McKinsey.com. 13   Park Han-na, “Seoul to launch 10-minute contact-tracing program,” The Korea Herald, March 26, 2020, koreaherald.com.

Additional initiatives could include  developing 360-degree views of the customer,  adopting consistent tool sets and processes, or  modernizing data architecture and moving to the  cloud. To get the full value from data in the future,  it will be important to retrain algorithms based on  new realities. At the same time, CEOs will need to work with their risk leaders to ensure that the  scramble to harness data follows strict privacy  rules and cyber best practice.  Increased digitalization has also highlighted the  increasing importance of ecosystems.  Responding to customer needs during the  crisis, for example, we’ve seen how some   banks integrated medical-care advice, doctor-  appointment services, and automotive services  for their customers. As protocols and standards  increasingly normalize these connections, the CEO  will need to help guide which ecosystems can drive  the greatest value for the business and how to  navigate the implications for customer relationships,  data sharing, and intellectual property—key sources  of advantage in the digital age.    We have not seen the end of the crisis. Nor do we  know exactly when the recovery will come. But it  will come, and the CEOs who can best prepare   their businesses effectively for a more digital  future will give their companies the best chance for  a brighter future.

The digital-led recovery from COVID-19: Five questions for CEOs  147   © Getty Images  Driving digital change during  a crisis: The chief digital  officer and COVID-19  Chief digital officers play a crucial role in driving the digital changes  needed for their organizations to respond to the crisis and prepare for  the next normal.  by Tarik Alatovic, Meraj Chhaya, Shweta Juneja, Kate Smaje, and Alex Sukharevsky  148   Amid the humanitarian crisis that has upended  lives and cast a veil of uncertainty over the future,  one thing is clear: we are living in a much more  digital world. As governments around the world  institute nationwide lockdowns, the demand  for digital services and products, from both  customers and employees stuck at home, has hit  record levels.   McKinsey’s consumer-sentiment surveys have  shown how significantly online sales have  increased across the globe, with new digital  activities—from ordering groceries online to  telemedicine—becoming standard behavior. At  the same time, hundreds of millions of remote  employees are relying on collaboration tools and  online processes to get work done.  This new digital reality presents a unique  challenge for chief digital officers (CDOs). Often  the most digital person in the organization, the  CDO, as “transformer in chief,” is charged with  leading a business’s digital transformation while  working closely with the CEO and the C-suite  to help shape the business response to the  crisis. Since the CDO role is relatively new, this  is also likely to be the first major crisis he or she   has faced. As such, the CDO now also has a true  opportunity to demonstrate resilience in a crisis  by driving the digital changes a business needs to  survive.   Having spoken to many CDOs since the crisis  began, and relying on our experience in helping  businesses navigate crises and drive digital  transformations, we believe CDOs can lead their  companies’ digital response across four dimensions:  resilient leadership; recrafting the digital strategy  and rebalancing the product road map; engaging  with customers; and updating agile practices to  accelerate remote delivery (exhibit).  1. Be a resilient leader for the  organization and your people The coronavirus is a humanitarian crisis that is  wreaking havoc on people’s lives. Amid the fear,  confusion, and disruption, CDOs have a leading role  to play in supporting their people by reassuring them  with empathy and clear action.   The shift to working remotely and the “all-hands- on-deck” demands to manage the crisis have put  incredible pressure on people. If poorly managed,   Web <year> Exhibit <article slug> Exhibit <x> of <y> To lead their companies’ digital response to the crisis, chief digital officers must  To lead their companies’ digital response to the crisis, chief digital o(cid:11)cers  act across four dimensions. must act across four dimensions.  Be a resilient leader for the  organization and your people  Scale the use of agile and tools for accelerated remote delivery  4  3  Four dimensions of   CDO leadership  during a crisis  1  2  Engage with customers now and prepare for the next normal  Recraft the digital strategy and rebalance the product road map  Driving digital change during a crisis: The chief digital officer and COVID-19   149   this situation could lead to burnout. CDOs should  be considering how to build in work flexibility  to account for employees taking care of kids  at home by, for example, shifting schedules;  ensure access to resources such as tools and  information-sharing intranets; educate less  digitally fluent colleagues so they don’t feel  overmatched by new demands with, for example,  brief training sessions; and have frequent  touchpoints such as digital town halls and pulse  surveys, to gauge people’s mental and physical  well-being. This goes beyond the typical work  check-ins and is absolutely necessary to help  employees deal with the unprecedented stress of  this current environment. People are a company’s  most precious resource, and how successful a  CDO is in making sure that his or her employees  are as healthy and supported as possible will be  a testament to his or her true leadership skills.  That focus on connecting with people extends, of  course, to the C-suite. Given the cross-functional  nature of digital transformations, the CDO should  be in constant communication with key leaders  to help them navigate the crisis and prepare for  the recovery. That could mean working with the  CFO to identify digital initiatives that can help  build up cash reserves, aligning with the CIO on  technology priorities to support prioritized digital  programs, working with the CHRO to determine  talent needs given accelerated digital programs,  and, of course, working with the CEO to mobilize  the organization around concepts that, in many  cases, are new or not particularly well known  to him or her, such as digital elements of the  operating model or digitally driven business  models.   2. Recraft the digital strategy and  rebalance the product road map To meet the surge in use of digital channels by  employees and customers, CDOs need to focus   both on short-term needs and on developing a  clear perspective of the business’s longer-term  digital future.   Our previous research has made it clear that  the best-performing companies have a digital  strategy that’s tightly aligned with the business’s  overall strategy. While the COVID-19 crisis has  introduced significant uncertainty about what  the future holds, CDOs can help to develop digital  strategies based on scenarios detailing customer  behavior shifts, business-model opportunities,  and their implications on digital and technology  choices. They can help determine where potential  sources of value might lie and determine  which assets the business has—such as data,  ecosystem collaborations, and platforms—and  which business models to develop to help capture  that value.   At the same time, the CDO should work closely  with his or her product leads as well as with the  CMO and CIO to shift product road-map priorities  so that resources are available to address the  most pressing needs, such as the following:    — How to serve customers in a manner that  safeguards their health, such as launching  QR payments or building contactless product- delivery capabilities. In the United States,  Walgreens has launched a service where  associates assemble orders and deliver them to  customers at a drive-through window.   — How to digitize interactions that used to be  handled in person, such as renewing debit  cards or ensuring services. China-based  Ping An Bank rolled out new “Do It At Home”  functionality, which resulted in more than  eight million page views and nearly 12 million  transactions in two weeks. Singapore-based  DBS used the CamelONE portal to settle trade- financing transactions.¹   1 “DBS accelerates trade digitalization efforts with more ‘industry firsts’ to drive greater efficiencies for customers,” DBS, March 2, 2020, dbs.com.  150  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020    — How to help transition customers from offline  to online channels, such as creating incentives  and support infrastructure (for example, scaling  up help desks).    — Identifying back-office tasks that can be   digitized and automated to support employees  working from home, such as code tests and  expense approvals.    — How innovative solutions can be rapidly   delivered as minimum viable products (MVPs)  to meet immediate customer demands, such  as apps for access to healthcare or food  delivery. Certain mobile-network operators are  providing online coupons to customers for free  mobile data for up to two months, while some  media companies are offering free e-book and  e-magazine subscriptions.    — How to work with regulators to help solve  pressing customer issues. In telemedicine,  for example, some regulations have been  temporarily sidelined in an effort to accelerate  how doctors help patients during the COVID-19   crisis. CDOs have a natural role in bringing  together relevant parties from different  functions across the business to be prepared to  act in the case of changes to regulations.    — What infrastructure needs to be in place   to support the development of new digital  channels and customer experiences, such  as using microservices or migrating particular  capabilities to the cloud to enable rapid  provisioning and load balancing.  videoconferencing tools to conduct interviews  remotely. Furthermore, given the paramount  importance of talent, the CDO should develop a  perspective on what sorts of talent will be needed  in the future when the recovery comes.   3. Engage with customers now and  prepare for the next normal The best CDOs act as the voice of the customer  and ensure that the customer is at the heart of all  decisions. In the current environment, that means  developing a clear view of how customer habits  and behaviors are changing, which of them are  likely to stick, and what the implications are for  the business. This customer perspective should  be communicated to both the C-suite and the  entire organization.  Since customer behavior is in the midst of a  massive shift, CDOs cannot rely on past truths.  What’s crucial is putting in place practices that  allow for a continuous reevaluation of customers’  priorities through test-and-learn exercises,  close monitoring, and data analysis. A caring  organization will also engage with customers for  feedback beyond the usual channels.   CDOs should emphasize design-thinking  principles, which are predicated on building  empathy with customers, to understand their  motivations. We know of CDOs who are reaching  out to customers for one-on-one conversations,  leading customer interviews, and compiling  surveys to better understand the challenges that  customers face.   Additional capacity will be necessary to deliver  on this changing road map. The CDO should work  closely with teams to temporarily reallocate digital  staff and use outsourcing options for temporary  staff augmentation. In the case where new people  are needed, the CDO should work with the CHRO  to create a plan for hiring people in the short  term, including understanding how to find talent  in previously unexplored geographies and use   As companies test new offers, channels, and  communications, which have been necessitated  by the crisis, the CDO needs to have in place  a sensitive tracking and analysis capability to  understand what’s working and what’s not so  he or she can double down on those that are  effective and eliminate those that aren’t. To  institutionalize this capability, CDOs should  consider creating a dedicated squad whose sole   Driving digital change during a crisis: The chief digital officer and COVID-19   151   responsibility is developing a deep understanding  of customers. Surveys, conversations, and  detailed data analysis on channel behavior—in  social media, online ads, and search engines— using updated algorithms that don’t rely on  outdated pattern recognition need to be part of  a customer understanding “reset.” The customer  insights gathered should drive priorities in  recrafting the product road map for product  improvements and feature development.  The CDO of a major mining corporation, for  example, learned that upstream partners  were frustrated about the lack of visibility into  production. So he created an online portal  to ensure transparency. In another example,  noting the concerns customers had around the  coronavirus, the CDO of a leading bank launched  a digital campaign to inform customers of the  steps it was taking to stop the spread of the virus  and offering digital options to support banking  transactions.  4. Scale use of agile and collaboration  tools for accelerated remote delivery  Agile working has been a well-established model  for teams looking to work quickly and efficiently.  In the past, however, the key issue has been how  to scale. With remote working conditions the  new standard, CDOs can use the moment as an  opportunity to better understand what it takes to  scale agile.   While co-locating agile teams has traditionally  been the most productive working model, the  necessity of remote working is putting that  experience to the test. The first element of  effective remote agile is just ensuring that  established ceremonies are followed, such as the  daily stand-up, sprint refinement and grooming,  sprint planning, sprint demo and review, and  sprint retrospective. Additionally, squads should  have ad hoc huddles as needed for design and  development, facilitated by the scrum master.  Ensuring that people can collaborate remotely  is crucial for this new agile model to work. In   the case of developers, for example, providing  environments so they can contribute remotely  and frequent automated deployments can take  place should be a priority for the CDO. Many  Chinese companies have rapidly adopted local  productivity solutions, such as Alibaba’s DingTalk  or WeChat Work to communicate and deliver  weekly meetings, training, and lectures.  Additionally, collaboration tools must be selected  based primarily on their familiarity to employees  and ease of integration, as opposed to cost,  while also ensuring proper security protocols  are followed. CDOs will need to collaborate with  information security and risk departments to  fast-track their approval, and take necessary  precautions to safeguard corporate data, such  as requiring the use of multifactor authentication,  virtual private networks (VPNs), and regular  automated backups. The CDO will also need to  closely collaborate with the CIO in making the  tools easily available to the digital employees.  Many of the tools are scalable because they  live on the cloud. CDOs, however, will need  to implement change-management efforts,  including training teams on how to use them  and defining new ways of working so that the  tools are used properly—and actually help. A  crucial component of this effort is for the CDO  to be a role model. This includes communication  of the importance of punctuality, of scheduling  ceremonies consistently, and of motivating  employees so that they always appear on video.  Surprise “visits” by the the CDO to ceremonies  can also help to motivate all tribes and squads.  Since teams are actively and continually learning  from these new ways of working, CDOs should  put in place systems to help share that learning  across the organization. Sprint retrospective  sessions should, in part, be used to determine  how the new remote way of working fits the  organization and to codify best practices.  Gamification can help, through posting  leaderboards and by rewarding those who  contribute the most learnings to the organization.   152  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   Leading an organization in a time of crisis is one  of the greatest challenges a CDO can face. But by  demonstrating resilient leadership and a clear view  of how to use digital to navigate the crisis, CDOs  can help the business not just to survive but also to  be ready for the next normal.  Perhaps most important, the CDO has a critical role  to play to ensure that a culture of experimentation  is maintained. The best learning comes from doing,  and trying something new inevitably results in  failures. If people are afraid of being punished for  failing, they won’t experiment. This nervousness  about failing is likely to be exacerbated during  this time of uncertainty, so the CDO has to take  a strong role in celebrating learnings based on  failures, pointing out his or her own failures and  learnings from them, and protecting people who  are willing to experiment.

Driving digital change during a crisis: The chief digital officer and COVID-19   153   ‘Transformer in chief’:   The new chief digital officer  © 10'000 Hours/Getty Images  The CDO role is changing dramatically. Here are the skills today’s   world demands.  by Tuck Rickards, Kate Smaje, and Vik Sohoni   154   In the alphabet soup that is today’s crowded  C-suite, few roles attract as much attention as that  of the chief digital officer, or CDO. While the position  isn’t exactly new, what’s required of the average  CDO is. Gone are the days of being responsible for  introducing basic digital capabilities and perhaps  piloting a handful of initiatives. The CDO is now a  “transformer in chief,” charged with coordinating and  managing comprehensive changes that address  everything from updating how a company works to  building out entirely new businesses. And he or she  must make progress quickly.  Given these demands, it’s not surprising that the  number of people in CDO roles doubled from  2013 to 2014 and is expected to double again this  year.1 We find that companies bring in a CDO for  two primary reasons. The first is when they need  to approach the complex root causes that must  be dissected, understood, and addressed before  any substantive progress on digitization can be  made. And the second is when the CEO realizes the  organization can’t meet the primary challenge of  creating integrated transformation within its current  construct (see sidebar, “Do you need a CDO?”).  In fact, the true measure of a CDO’s success is when  the role becomes unnecessary: by its very nature, a  high-functioning digital company does not need a  CDO (however, it may want its former CDO to be the  CEO). Of course, the vast majority of organizations  are not yet at that point. And while there are  numerous actions companies can and should take  to help these executives work themselves out  of a job—such as providing sufficient resources  and active CEO support—this article focuses on  five areas CDOs themselves must get right if their  organizations are to successfully transition to digital.  1. Make digital integral to the strategy Digital isn’t merely a thing—it’s a new way of  doing things. Many companies are focused on  developing a digital strategy when they should  instead focus on integrating digital into all aspects  of the business, from channels and processes and   data to the operating model, incentives, and culture.  Our analysis of how companies with a high Digital  Quotient (DQ) operate shows that 90 percent of top  performers have fully integrated digital initiatives  into their strategic-planning process.2  Getting the strategy right requires the CDO to  work closely with the CEO, the chief information  officer (CIO), business-unit leaders, and the chief  financial officer; the CDO also needs to be an  active participant in and shaper of the strategy.  An important foundation for CDOs to establish  credibility and secure a seat at the strategy table  is providing detailed analysis of market trends and  developments in technology and customer behavior,  both inside and outside the sector.  Yet CDOs can’t stop there. They need to bring a bold  vision: 65 percent of companies that are “digital  leaders” in our DQ analysis have a high tolerance  for bold initiatives; among average performers,  70 percent of companies don’t see support for  risk taking. This vision could include starting new  businesses, acquiring technologies, or investing in  innovations—one CDO we know made it his mantra  to drive agile as a new software-development  methodology for 40 percent of the company’s  projects. No matter how it’s branded, CDOs need  to be known within their organization for something  that is courageous, new, and adds value.  In addition, CDOs must be specific about their goals.  One international publishing house, for example,  set a target of generating 50 percent of its revenue  and profit from digital media within ten years, and it  wound up doing so in almost half that time. Similarly,  several banks that set the objective of increasing  digital-channel sales to more than 50 percent are  seeing that specific and measurable goal rally the  organization.  2. Obsess over the customer While most companies say they know their  customers, CDOs must make it a driving passion  and core competency of the organization. With   1 Karl Greenberg, “Chief digital officers grow in ranks and prominence,” MediaPost, May 7, 2015, mediapost.com. 2 See Tanguy Catlin, Jay Scanlan, and Paul Willmott, “Raising your Digital Quotient,” McKinsey Quarterly, June 2015.  ‘Transformer in chief’: The new chief digital officer  155   Do you need a CDO?  Companies looking to begin or continue  their digital transformation will benefit  from considering five questions to help  determine whether a CDO is necessary:   — Is my company ready to move beyond  basic digital experiments and embark  on a fundamental and integrated  transformation of the business?   — Do we need a disruptive perspective   from someone who can objectively and  credibly challenge the status quo with a  “digital first” mindset?   — Is the marketplace where I compete   undergoing—or vulnerable to— significant changes that are reshaping  value?   — Is my company ready to signal its digital- transformation efforts to audiences both  internal and external?   — Does the current leadership team    have the capacity to steward the  digital transformation and support this   new role?  technology and customer habits changing so  quickly, developing a deep and detailed view of  customer behavior across all channels provides a  common reference point in any business discussion  and arms the CDO to challenge the status quo  and make changes. For example, one CDO used  the concept of customer journeys and big data  mapping of these paths to show her peers where  opportunities and pain points existed—and, in doing  so, destroyed several myths.  This type of analysis is critical, to be sure, but  an equally important part of the CDO’s job is  communicating how essential the customer is to the  organization. One CDO created clear and visually  compelling dashboards on the customer journey  and made a habit of consistently referencing them  in meetings and when making decisions. Another  set up a digitally enabled “war room” with real-time  reporting on several key digital metrics, which soon  will be piped to the tablets and smartphones of  other C-suite executives. Yet another CDO sends  regular company-wide emails highlighting customer  breakthroughs, insights, and “voice of the customer”  anecdotes. Such actions can help the business start  to think more specifically about the customer so that  everyone approaches all issues with a single crucial  question: How will this affect the customer?  Digital capabilities ultimately provide an important  foundation for improving the customer experience.   It’s up to the CDO to identify those functions  where digital is critical: for example, investing  in automation capabilities to rapidly respond to  customer interactions, developing sophisticated  reporting and analytics capabilities to interpret  customer needs, building innovative interfaces to  gather customer data (for example, an alternative  payment method), and creating mechanisms  to deliver content and offers across all relevant  channels. While the CDO will need to work closely  with marketing and IT leadership, he or she should  define the customer-experience journey and  identify the requirements for developing and then  supporting a dynamic system that is constantly  learning and evolving.  3. Build agility, speed, and data CDOs can build strong foundations for change  by creating a “spirit of digital” throughout the  organization. That could include setting up coding  days for the board or holding company-wide  hackathons—one company we know even had  drones flying around the atrium of its headquarters.  Core to building this spirit, however, is increasing  the “metabolic rate” of the organization. That starts  with changing basic habits, such as having strategy  leadership meetings weekly or even biweekly to  help ingrain the idea of moving at a faster pace.  CDOs must look at how the organization operates  and find ways to inject speed into processes. In   156  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   some cases, it could be as straightforward as  working with IT to automate existing development  processes. But in others, it will require radically  changing how the company works, such as setting  extremely aggressive goals—as few as six weeks— for getting a product to market. Some CDOs do  this by setting up “digital factories,” which are  cross-functional groups focused on developing one  product or process using a different technology,  operational, or managerial methodology from the  rest of the company. Embedding these factories  in business units has the advantage of spreading  the new culture and making the digital-factory  approach the norm.  Managing a portfolio of these types of initiatives  requires leaders to be decisive. If the data show a  prototype doesn’t work, the CDO must be ruthless  about killing the project, incorporating anything  learned from the experience, and moving on. On  the other hand, CDOs should establish flexible  budgeting processes so that projects that show  signs of success can get resources to scale quickly.  4. Extend networks In a digital world, threats often do not come from  established competitors but rather from innovative  technologies that enable new businesses, start-ups  that undermine established business models, or  new developments outside the way the company  defined its competitive space. For example, one of  the big trends in the payments sector is the merging  of commerce and payments functionalities in the  same app—so, being able to pay for your restaurant  meal using the OpenTable app you used to reserve  your table.  Successful CDOs are keenly aware of such trends.  They build networks of people, technologies, and  ideas far outside of their company, constantly  scanning the small-business landscape to  identify possible acquisitions or partners that  can provide complementary capabilities. Some  CDOs spend as much as 50 percent of their time  working with external partners to build effective  working relationships that take advantage of every  organization’s capabilities. To help bring these   outside voices into the organization, many CDOs  establish advisory boards of start-up leaders or  create “challenger” boards of people with digital  experience and expertise to review corporate  initiatives and strategies. At a more pedestrian level,  they regularly invite technologists or entrepreneurs  to team lunches.  Building an internal network is just as important  because company systems and technologies need  to be flexible enough to work with outside parties.  In particular, CDOs need to work with IT leaders to  develop application programming interfaces and  cloud-based architecture that works with a broader  ecosystem of providers. Some CDOs realize too late  that functions such as compliance, finance, human  resources, legal, procurement, and risk also need to  change to support a more digitally focused company.  At one company, for example, an effort to accelerate  time to market is in full swing, but procurement  still insists it requires six months to approve a  vendor. Changing such supporting processes  isn’t easy—functions often have good reasons for  why processes are undertaken as they are. But  brokering compromises and testing new ways of  operating that are necessary to make progress  will be virtually impossible if a CDO doesn’t build  internal networks early and engage with leaders  across the business.  5. Get stuff done CDOs are ultimately judged not by the quality of  their ideas but by their ability to lead different types  of teams, guide projects, overcome hurdles, and  deliver integrated change.  Getting stuff done often requires hard-nosed  negotiating skills. Consider the CDO at a financial- services company who wanted to stop business  units from draining IT resources on independent  projects that didn’t align with the overarching  strategy. The CDO worked closely with the CIO and  agreed to use her new budget to fund some of his  projects; she also helped him retain and motivate  key people by staffing them on important digital  initiatives (which also assured him visibility into what  she was doing). In return, the CIO agreed to stop   ‘Transformer in chief’: The new chief digital officer  157   The importance of soft skills should   not be understated: some CDOs estimate  they spend 80 percent of their time   building relationships.   supporting initiatives that the CDO didn’t explicitly  approve. Both won in the end, and they now have a  close working relationship.  A new CDO will benefit from the early establishment  of near-term goals that can yield quick wins and  wow moments that help build enthusiasm and  momentum. Some CDOs find that building the  marketing-commerce function is a great way to  quickly demonstrate value, while others embark  on accelerated cost cutting by automating core  processes. It pays to define how success is measured,  whether it’s tracking key digital and business  metrics—such as digital-media revenue as a  percentage of total revenue—or creating a full digital  profit-and-loss statement (or both). To be meaningful  for the business overall and to build credibility, key  performance indicators must be aligned with those  used by established business units.  Within his first month, for example, the new CDO  at one financial-services company defined clear,  discrete digital initiatives; developed a long-term  vision in partnership with an anchor business- unit leader; and got his budget approved. Within  six months, he hired a handful of key employees,  launched several initiatives, identified gaps in the  organization, and pulled together teams to fill them.  A year and a half into the job, he was able to claim  some solid wins and moved from a “shadow” profit  and loss to an explicit one.  Of course, the projects CDOs commit to must be  core to the business—such as developing new  revenue streams, cutting costs, or getting to market  faster—and not peripheral experiments, which could  end up marginalizing their efforts. We’ve actually  found it works best when a CDO’s budget is funded  through the efficiencies and growth that he or she   drives. In addition, we believe that budgeting is  critical to ensuring that things get done. Successful  CDOs not only time their actions to maximize  budgetary flexibility but also change how funding  is allocated. One CDO shifted from annual approval  of large capital expenses for IT to a more venture  capital–like monthly cycle, ensuring he could get  more projects funded and launched. This approach  also served to maintain funding momentum, with  small bites over the course of the year predicated on  demonstrated effectiveness.  Defining characteristics of the   new CDO When hiring a CDO, people often agonize over  finding someone with experience that is just right.  Yet we’ve found it’s the ability to lead transformation  across an organization that is the true indicator  of likely success in the role, and that requires a  combination of hard and soft skills. Hard skills  include the ability to articulate a strategic vision,  the means to take on problems by identifying  root causes across functions and making the  tough decisions necessary to resolve them,  experience in “pure play” digital and larger company  transformations (typically in the consumer and  technology sectors), and the managerial ability to  lead and see programs through to fruition.  The importance of soft skills should not be  understated: some CDOs estimate they spend   80 percent of their time building relationships. In  our experience, successful CDOs have the patience  to navigate the complex organizational structures  of large businesses; additionally, they collaborate  to get buy-in across functions and are able to  diplomatically challenge the status quo and solidify  relationships with a broad group of people. They   158  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   also demonstrate leadership and charisma that  excites the organization to drive change forward.  Of course, companies would be lucky to have  executives in any function with this skill set. But  driving organization-wide change is different from  the mandate for other senior roles. A recent Russell  Reynolds Associates survey found that CDOs are  meaningfully different from other senior executives  across five categories: they are on average 34  percent more likely to be innovative and 32 percent  more likely to be disruptive, and also differ with  regard to determination, boldness of leadership,  and social adeptness.³ Leading an organizational  transformation is messy work that requires  masterful social skills to implement digital initiatives  that create disruption by their very nature. Indeed,   a CDO’s strong bias for action, bold thinking, and  high tolerance for risk requires someone who can  also manage the ruffled feathers, bruised egos, and  flaring tempers that are common fallout from his or  her activities.  As the digital age scrambles the traditional  organizational structure, CDOs must not only launch  the organization on its digital trajectory but also help  it fundamentally evolve. The role requires a “bifocal”  approach: achieving the near-term imperative  of getting things moving quickly, while setting in  place the longer-term conditions of success so the  organization can compete digitally. Those CDOs  that succeed will truly have earned their place in the  already-crowded C-suite.  3  For more on this survey, see “Productive disruptors: Five characteristics that differentiate transformational leaders,” Russell Reynolds  Associates, August 12, 2015, russellreynolds.com.

Here’s our cheat sheet for   the C-suite.  by Kate Smaje and Chris Wigley  160   For many consumers, being digital is second  nature. Activities unknown a few years ago  are now commonplace: using a smartphone  to compare prices while shopping, or seeking  product recommendations using Facebook. Yet an  organization’s top table can take a while to catch  up to this reality. After all, most of today’s senior  executives built their careers in the predigital age  and for the past ten years have been too busy hitting  their numbers to spend much time following tech  trends or posting on social media.  If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone: we often hear  from leaders we work with that they feel left behind  by the digital revolution. So here are a few practical  tips that we’ve found help senior executives make the  transition from analog to digital:  1. Think like a geek Set up a challenge session. Get your senior leaders,  tech team, and marketers together to confront the  critical question: If software is eating the world,  how could it eat us? For example, one European  media company asked executives from a bunch  of start-ups, “How could you disrupt us? Which  activities would you replace with algorithms? What  advantages do we have that you can’t replicate?”  Not only were they surprised by the results—they  acted on them.  Teach your team to program an app. Demystify  technology by taking a handful of direct reports—or  your C-suite peers—to a one-day course. Even a  novice can learn to write simple code in a day. It’s  the digital equivalent of looking under the bonnet (or  hood) to see how the engine works.  2. Carve out time to look beyond   your company Get a news feed of tech developments in your  industry. Try a “5 at 5”: Every day, put aside five  minutes at five o’clock to get smart about a topic. If a  news item or an article or a blog makes you see your  business in a new light, share it with others—why not  tweet it?  Hold regular meetings with innovators. When  people are perpetually fire-fighting, it’s easy to miss  what’s going on in the outside world. Invite industry  innovators to come in; you may find new talent to  hire or new options to pursue. Build networks as   well as knowledge, and raise your internal and  external profile as a company that’s receptive to  fresh thinking.  3. Behave like your customer Think mobile. Over a billion people have a  smartphone in their pocket. Think what you like  doing on yours, then honestly consider what your  company is putting on that small screen. Does it  make consumers’ lives better, easier, faster? Are  you putting their needs first or optimizing for a  marketing campaign? You’ll be amazed at how many  things you could do better.  Don’t ignore that app everyone’s using. Download  it; engage with it. Do you have an Instagram account,  pin on Pinterest, rent your holiday home from  Airbnb? It’s time you did. Need pointers? Ask your  kids. Keep going: What opportunities could social,  curated, and marketplace approaches open up for  your company?  4. Surround yourself with the right  people Find a “reverse mentor.” Get that interesting new  hire with the funny haircut to send you snippets to  guide you through the digital world. Ask your CIO or  CTO to suggest likely candidates, spend ten minutes  talking to them, and select whoever gave you most  to think about.  Be thoughtful about your team. Get your head of  HR and commercial director to identify your top  digital talent. Then ask, What are they are doing?  Who are we hiring? Do we have the right roles  and structures? Do we need a digital officer or an  “innovator without portfolio”?  Five habits for executives to become more digital  161   5. Remember it’s 99 percent  perspiration Sweat the small stuff. Get excited about your  backlog of tech improvements, not just your  three-year plan. What’s being launched in your  next release? How will it enhance the customer  experience? Improving load times on your website  isn’t just a detail for the tech team; ease of use is  something you should be passionate about.  Increase your metabolic rate. Finish your meetings  in half the time. Ask how you can complete a task  in one month rather than six. Favor quick-and-dirty   work-arounds over purpose-built solutions. Set a  culture of try, fail fast, learn, move on. And don’t  reinvent the wheel. One company was planning to  develop its own instant communication system but  ended up using Snapchat instead; it was available,  free, and it did the job.  Remember, these are tips, not a to-do list. Start  with one or two and see how easily they fit into  your everyday routine. They may be small, but their  collective impact on you and your company could be  enormous. Have fun!  Kate Smaje and Chris Wigley are principals in McKinsey’s London office.

Here  are seven traits that successful digital enterprises share.  by Tunde Olanrewaju, Kate Smaje, and Paul Willmott  163   The age of experimentation with digital is over.  In an often bleak landscape of slow economic  recovery, digital continues to show healthy growth.  E-commerce is growing at double-digit rates in  the United States and most European countries,  and it is booming across Asia. To take advantage of  this momentum, companies need to move beyond  experiments with digital and transform themselves  into digital businesses. Yet many companies are  stumbling as they try to turn their digital agendas  into new business and operating models. The  reason, we believe, is that digital transformation  is uniquely challenging, touching every function  and business unit while also demanding the rapid  development of new skills and investments that  are very different from business as usual. To  succeed, management teams need to move beyond  vague statements of intent and focus on “hard  wiring” digital into their organization’s structures,  processes, systems, and incentives.  There is no blueprint for success, but there are  plenty of examples that offer insights into the  approaches and actions of a successful digital  transformation. By studying dozens of these  successes—looking beyond the usual suspects—we  discovered that effective digital enterprises share  these seven traits.  1. Be unreasonably aspirational Leadership teams must be prepared to think quite  differently about how a digital business operates.  Digital leaders set aspirations that, on the surface,  seem unreasonable. Being “unreasonable” is a  way to jar an organization into seeing digital as a  business that creates value, not as a channel that  drives activities. Some companies frame their  targets by measures such as growth or market share  through digital channels. Others set targets for  cost reduction based on the cost structures of new  digital competitors. Either way, if your targets aren’t  making the majority of your company feel nervous,  you probably aren’t aiming high enough.  When Angela Ahrendts became CEO of Burberry,  in 2006, she took over a stalling business whose   brand had become tarnished. But she saw what no  one else could: that a high-end fashion retailer could  remake itself as a digital brand. Taking personal  control of the digital agenda, she oversaw a series  of groundbreaking initiatives, including a website  (ArtoftheTrench.com) that featured customers as  models, a more robust e-commerce catalog that  matched the company’s in-store inventory, and  the digitization of retail stores through features  such as radio-frequency identification tags. During  Ahrendts’s tenure, revenues tripled. (Apple hired  Ahrendts last October to head its retail business.)  Netflix was another brand with an unreasonably  aspirational vision. It had built a successful online  DVD rental business, but leadership saw that the  future of the industry would be in video streaming,  not physical media. The management team saw how  quickly broadband technology was evolving and  made a strategic bet that placed it at the forefront  of a surge in real-time entertainment. As the video- streaming market took off, Netflix quickly captured  nearly a third of downstream video traffic. By  the end of 2013, Netflix had more than 40 million  streaming subscribers.  2. Acquire capabilities The skills required for digital transformation  probably can’t be groomed entirely from within.  Leadership teams must be realistic about the  collective ability of their existing workforce. Leading  companies frequently look to other industries to  attract digital talent, because they understand that  emphasizing skills over experience when hiring new  talent is vital to success, at least in the early stages  of transformation. The best people in digital product  management or user-experience design may not  work in your industry. Hire them anyway.  Tesco, the UK grocery retailer, made three  significant digital acquisitions over a two-year span:  blinkbox, a video-streaming service; We7, a digital  music store; and Mobcast, an e-book platform. The  acquisitions enabled Tesco to quickly build up the  skills it needed to move into digital media. In the  United States, Verizon followed a similar path with   164  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   The leaders of incumbent companies  must aggressively challenge   the status quo rather than accepting   historical norms.  strategic acquisitions that immediately bolstered  its expertise in telematics (Hughes Telematics in  2012) and cloud services (CloudSwitch in 2011), two  markets that are growing at a rapid pace.  headquarters. The group’s innovations, including  a unified company-wide e-commerce platform,  helped Wal-Mart increase online revenues by 30  percent in 2013, outpacing Amazon’s rate of growth.  This “acqui-hire” approach is not the only option.  But we have observed that significant lateral hiring  is required in the early stages of a transformation  to create a pool of talent deep enough to execute  against an ambitious digital agenda and plant the  seeds for a new culture.  3. ‘Ring fence’ and cultivate talent A bank or retailer that acquires a five-person  mobile-development firm and places it in the  middle of its existing web operations is more likely  to lose the team than to assimilate it. Digital talent  must be nurtured differently, with its own working  patterns, sandbox, and tools. After a few false  starts, Wal-Mart Stores learned that “ring fencing”  its digital talent was the only way to ensure rapid  improvements. Four years ago, the retail giant’s  online business was lagging. It was late to the  e-commerce market as executives protected their  booming physical-retail business. When it did  step into the digital space, talent was disbursed  throughout the business. Its $5 billion in online sales  in 2011 paled next to Amazon’s $48 billion.  In 2011, however, Wal-Mart established   @WalmartLabs, an “idea incubator,” as part of its  growing e-commerce division in Silicon Valley—far  removed from the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas,   Wal-Mart took ring fencing to the extreme, turning  its e-commerce business into a separate vertical  with its own profit and loss. This approach won’t work  for every incumbent, and even when it does, it is not  necessarily a long-term solution. Thus Telefónica this  year recombined with the core business Telefónica  Digital, a separate business unit created in 2011  to nurture and strengthen its portfolio of digital  initiatives. To deliver in an omnichannel world, where  customers expect seamless integration of digital and  analog channels, seamless internal integration should  be the end goal.  4. Challenge everything The leaders of incumbent companies must  aggressively challenge the status quo rather than  accepting historical norms. Look at how everything  is done, including the products and services you  offer and the market segments you address, and ask  “Why?” Assume there is an unknown start-up asking  the exact same question as it plots to disrupt your  business. It is no coincidence that many textbook  cases of companies redefining themselves come  from Silicon Valley, the epicenter of digital disruption.  Think of Apple’s transformation from struggling  computer maker into (among other things) the world’s  largest music retailer, or eBay’s transition from online  bazaar to global e-commerce platform.  The seven traits of effective digital enterprises  165   Digital leaders examine all aspects of their  business—both customer-facing and back-office  systems and processes, up and down the supply  chain—for digitally driven innovation. In 2007, car- rental company Hertz started to deploy self-service  kiosks similar to those used by airlines for flight  check-in. In 2011, it leapfrogged airlines by moving  to dual-screen kiosks—one screen to select rental  options via touch screen, a second screen at eye  level to communicate with a customer agent using  real-time video.  We see digital leaders thinking expansively about  partnerships to deliver new value-added experiences  and services. This can mean alliances that span  industry sectors, such as the Energy@home  partnership among Electrolux, Enel, Indesit, and  Telecom Italia to create a communications platform  for smart devices and domestic appliances.  5. Be quick and data driven Rapid decision making is critical in a dynamic digital  environment. Twelve-month product-release cycles  are a relic. Organizations need to move to a cycle  of continuous delivery and improvement, adopting  methods such as agile development and “live  beta,” supported by big data analytics, to increase  the pace of innovation. Continuous improvement  requires continuous experimentation, along with a  process for quickly responding to bits of information.  Integrating data sources into a single system that  is accessible to everyone in the organization will  improve the “clock speed” for innovation. P&G, for  example, created a single analytics portal, called  the Decision Cockpit, which provides up-to-date  sales data across brands, products, and regions to  more than 50,000 employees globally. The portal,  which emphasizes projections over historical  data, lets teams quickly identify issues, such as  declining market share, and take steps to address  the problems.  U.S. Xpress, a US transportation company, collects  data in real time from tens of thousands of sources,  including in-vehicle sensors and geospatial systems.  Using Apache Hadoop, an open-source tool set for   data analysis, and real-time business-intelligence  tools, U.S. Xpress has been able to extract game- changing insights about its fleet operations. For  example, looking at the fuel consumption of idling  vehicles led to changes that saved the company  more than $20 million in fuel consumption in the first  year alone.  6. Follow the money Many organizations focus their digital investments  on customer-facing solutions. But they can extract  just as much value, if not more, from investing  in back-office functions that drive operational  efficiencies. A digital transformation is more   than just finding new revenue streams; it’s also  about creating value by reducing the costs of   doing business.  Investments in digital should not be spread  haphazardly across the organization under the halo  of experimentation. A variety of frequent testing is  critical, but teams must quickly zero in on the digital  investments that create the most value—and then  double down.  Often, great value is found in optimizing back- office functions. At Starbucks, one of the leaders  in customer-experience innovation, just 35 of  100 active IT projects in 2013 were focused on  customer- or partner-facing initiatives. One-third of  these projects were devoted to improving efficiency  and productivity away from the retail stores, and  one-third focused on improving resilience and  security. In manufacturing, P&G collaborated with  the Los Alamos National Laboratory to create  statistical methods to streamline processes and  increase uptime at its factories, saving more than   $1 billion a year.  7. Be obsessed with the customer Rising customer expectations continue to push  businesses to improve the customer experience  across all channels. Excellence in one channel is  no longer sufficient; customers expect the same  frictionless experience in a retail store as they do  when shopping online, and vice versa. Moreover,   166  The Next Normal: The recovery will be digital  August 2020   they are less accepting of bad experiences; one  survey found that 89 percent of consumers began  doing business with a competitor following a poor  customer experience. On the flip side, 86 percent  said they were willing to pay more for a better  customer experience.¹  This mindset is what enables companies to go  beyond what’s normal and into the extraordinary. If  online retailer Zappos is out of stock on a product,  it will help you find the item from a competitor. Little  wonder that 75 percent of its orders come from  repeat customers.  A healthy obsession with improving the customer  experience is the foundation of any digital  transformation. No enterprise is perfect, but  leadership teams should aspire to fix every error or  bad experience. Processes that enable companies to  capture and learn from every customer interaction— positive or negative—help them to regularly test  assumptions about how customers are using digital  and constantly fine-tune the experience.  Leaders of successful digital businesses know that  it’s not enough to develop just one or two of these  traits. The real innovators will learn to excel at all  seven of them. Doing so requires a radically different  mindset and operating approach.  1  2011 Customer Experience Impact Report: Getting to the Heart of the Consumer and Brand Relationship, Oracle, 2012, oracle.com.

The response to the pandemic was  first and foremost human, through an outstanding  mobilisation of the caregivers, women and men  working on the front line. Their service to the  community showed how technology alone is not a  cure-all. For many of us, the period was nonetheless  substantially digital. Digital practices have experienced  a breakthrough, helping to maintain social and family  cohesion and accelerating adoption of teleworking,  telemedicine, distance learning, and online access  to culture and knowledge, among others. These  practices, new to some, will not go away when the  virus subsides. This great crisis brings many lasting  transformations, and digital transformation is not the  least.  In this regard, tech companies bear a heavy  responsibility. We have known this for a long time  and we have been talking about it every year since  2018, on the eve of Viva Tech, in a multi-stakeholder  forum: at the forefront of digital transformation, tech  players should think more broadly than their own  interests and serve as pathfinders for society as a  whole. The scale of the challenges facing tech firms  has grown steadily during the past three years, at a  time when access to and mastery of digital technology  are valuable keys to education, health or work. This is  also a time when the environmental footprint of digital  is uncertain, and when the under-representation of  women in science and technology highlights the need  for professional equality in the digital sector.   On each of these issues, with the methodological,  strategic, and knowledge support of McKinsey  teams, the Tech for Good companies undertook  commitments during the 2019 Summit and have since  begun to implement them. Faced with the epidemic,  they reacted to the crisis by rapidly mobilising  resources. This progress report is its modest testimony  but it is mainly dedicated to trace the trajectory over  the next few months.   There is still so much to do! The early successes must  herald deeper, more practical and lasting change  in people’s lives in France, Europe, and the world.  Beyond paying lip service to CSR, Tech for Good  companies, corporate groups and startups, will need  to transform themselves and, together with the  support of civil society and the research community,  find development models that put digital at the service  of humanity, rather than the other way round.  The next Summit will provide an opportunity to  collectively draw up a report on actions that have been  undertaken, and to explore how to mobilise digital  technology and artificial intelligence responsibly  to meet major humanitarian challenges. The crisis  we are going through will leave traces. We have the  responsibility to build the fairer world that our children  expect, one in which innovation contributes to the  common good.  5  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Executive  summary  The Tech for Good Summit, an initiative of the French  Presidency founded in 2018, brings together a diverse  group of corporate and non-profit leaders from some  of the most dynamic organizations across the world.  Tech for Good is composed of five groups of 15 to 20  organizations, including large companies (tech and  non-tech), NGOs, investment funds and startups.  Over the past twelve months, the five groups  developed new cross-company initiatives while  delivering on the engagements taken by the more  than 80 CEOs during the 2019 Summit. When the  COVID-19 crisis broke out, they analyzed the impact  of the pandemic on each of their areas of focus and  developed concrete actions to face the challenges  brought by the crisis. The groups’ broad aims and  objectives are as follows:  — The Tech for Education group aims at training   students in technology while supporting  technology usage in education. During the COVID- 19 crisis, Tech for Education members accelerated  their initiatives to support students better, and,  in parallel, launched concrete initiatives to supply  digital learning equipment, provide remote  coaching and tutoring to students, and deploy tech  solutions and tools for students and teachers.   — The Future of Work group addresses the skill-shift  needs brought by the unprecedent technological  disruption caused by automation and digitization  by defining and promoting trainings on soft-skills  and technological skills. During the lock-down,  Future of Work members worked as a group to  provide the French Ministry of Labor with a list of  more than 50 best practices to ensure workers’  health, reinforce business agility, adapt working  procedures, and prepare for the future—to be  used as a support for future public policies.   — The Tech for Diversity group aims to promote  gender equity and a business ecosystem that  promotes inclusion, mainly by increasing   6  representation of women in leadership positions  and tech roles. While the crisis might challenge  gender diversity targets, Tech for Diversity  members reaffirm their willingness to match their  commitments within timeframe while considering  an additional commitment still under discussion to  mitigate the impact of the crisis on women.   — The members of the Tech for Economic   Inclusiveness group aim at reducing inequalities by  digitally empowering their ecosystem—including  staff, clients, partners, suppliers, communities,  and stakeholders. During the COVID-19 crisis, Tech  for Economic Inclusiveness members deployed  concrete actions to face immediate challenges  brought by the crisis, in particular by providing  access to electronic equipment, supplying training  in digital skills to individuals in need, and fostering  innovative digital services and solutions.   — The Tech for Environment group has the objective  of decreasing environmental footprint in line with  the Paris Agreement and promoting tech solutions  to achieve it. Furthermore, the Tech for Environment  group has been analyzing how to participate in a  “green recovery” from the current crisis.  Finally, this report presents new perspectives for  reflections. It shares some of the most impactful  initiatives developed by the Tech for Good startup  ecosystem both before and during the COVID-19 crisis.  The common ambition of the Tech for Good Summit,  VivaTech and the Tech for Good startup ecosystem is  to increase collaboration of actors of all sizes around  “for good” initiatives. Reflections on Tech for Good in  Africa (especially the COVID-19 impact on the African  Tech for Good ecosystem), on Artificial Intelligence  opportunities to address humanitarian challenges  and on Accountable Tech with the role companies can  further play in mitigating tech risks are also presented  in this report. Lastly, the report opens on an active  reflection on the role of technology after the crisis.  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for Good  consolidated impact  Since its inception, the Tech for Good Summit has  driven significant impact in terms of access to  education, gender equity, and preparation for the  future of work. The recent addition of workstreams  dedicated to leveraging tech to tackle broader  economic inclusiveness and environmental issues  will ensure that the overall impact of Tech for Good  initiatives will increase substantially in the coming  years.  Members of the Tech for Good Summit commit to  digitally empowering and training millions of people  in technology and soft skills, while promoting gender  diversity and acting on climate change (Exhibit 1).  Progress on these commitments is detailed in the  following sections.  Exhibit 1  Overall commitment of Tech for Good workstreams  Education  At least 1 million students  trained in technology by 2022  Economic Inclusiveness  People digitally empowered by 2025   At least   1 million   in France   At least   5 million   worldwide  Future of work  At least 100,000 individuals trained  with our soft-skills taxonomy by 2022  1.

The COVID- 19 crisis is a reminder that technology is of paramount  importance to education. Through the Tech for good  process launched by President Macron and beyond,  many of us have taken significant actions to shape the  future of education as a more inclusive one. Some of  these initiatives are highlighted in this report, which  shows significant progress of our action.  This crisis is an impetus to accelerate. Economies and  societies are under tremendous stress. The specter  of a growing divide—not only digital—between the  haves and the have-nots risks becoming more acute.  In the Education workstream, we are passionate that  this digital era be more inclusive and more human.  Technology applied smartly can reinforce the value  of remote digital learning in bridging divides and  providing greater access to economic opportunity  after the crisis.   Now is the perfect time to embrace new models,  for governments, companies and NGOs to unite, to  sit with educators and rethink schools and learning,  to serve common goals: pedagogical continuity,  equal access to educational content, and to new  skills training opportunities for the in-demand jobs.  For employers to hire based on skills first, not on a  four-year college degree. This is a crucial time for  Tech to bring technologies to people, giving them the  right skills to be successful in this digital era. From  words to actions, we are delighted to share how this  workstream has decided to scale its initiatives and to  launch new ones, in France and around the world.   Jean-Laurent Bonnafé,   Director and CEO of BNP Paribas Ginni Rometty,   Executive Chairman of IBM  Overall commitment  Within the Tech for Education workstream,  17 international companies, startups  and NGOs from diverse sectors—both  tech and non-tech—collectively make a  commitment to training more than one  million students in technology by 2022. To  reach their ambition, these organizations  are joining forces to run a wide range of  initiatives and concrete actions across the  globe.  9  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Progress on 2019   initiatives  Over the previous two Tech for Good Summits,  members of the Tech for Education workstream  launched the following major initiatives:  First, a series of “pathways in technology” classes,  known as P-TECH, aimed at helping youth from all  backgrounds acquire skills and access opportunities  for entry-level jobs in high-growth industries—with  massive support from member-company volunteers  and a special focus on students who need it most.  Created in a school in Brooklyn (United States) nine  years ago by IBM, the New York City Department of  Education and the City University New York, P-TECH  has now scaled to be implemented in more than 220  schools in 24 countries1. A total of 150,000 students  have been onboarded globally.  In France, the initiative was launched just one year ago  with two pilots in the Paris and in the northern regions,  is scaling fast.  Despite the crisis, educators, companies and public  authorities joined forces to open new pilots in 2020  to triple the total number of pilots and increase  support to students to prepare for jobs of the future.  In September 2020, a cohort of 500 volunteers from  ten member-partners (companies and graduate  schools) will coach 200 students for a five-year period  in France. From there, the group wants to continue  expand the initiative rapidly, with the full support of  the Education ministry.  On these six P-TECH pilots only and without potential  new openings, almost 1,000 students will be reached  by 20252.  1  Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, France,  Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South  Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong, Egypt,  Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Thailand.  2  Each year, a new class (“seconde” grade) will be opened in each of the six  schools. This forecast is calculated based on a constant perimeter of six  P-TECH schools, and does not take into account potential new openings.  10  “With P-TECH, we have the opportunity  to meet committed women and men,  driven by a generous enthusiasm, flawless  optimism, talents with multiple resources  inspiring both our students and ourselves.  Certainly, there is a P-TECH spirit, which  accompanies us students, teachers,  mentors, partners at each stage of the  journey.” Laurence Guiganton, P-TECH literature and history  professor, vocational school La Tournelle,   La Garenne-Colombes  “This relationship I have with my mentor  is one of the best part of P-TECH. I also  liked the immersion week at the partner  companies, which was fun and instructive.” Hanane, P-TECH student, vocational school   La Tournelle, La Garenne-Colombes  “For me integrating P-TECH is a real asset,  both for the experiences we have the  chance to live and the opportunities of  being hired more easily at the end of the  studies, associating global companies on  our resume.” Stan, P-TECH student, vocational school   La Tournelle, La Garenne-Colombes  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Exhibit 2  P-Tech pilots in France (x3 in 2020 vs. 2019)   2019 pilot   2020 pilot   Lycée La Tournelle La Garenne-Colombes   Lycée Edmond Labbé  Douai   Lycée Pierre-Gilles  de Gennes ENCPB  Paris XIII   Lycée Gustave Ferrié  Paris X   Lycée Champollion Lattes / Montpellier   Lycée Fourcade  Gardanne / Marseille  “The journey accomplished together  with the student I am mentoring is quite  exceptional as we succeeded in building  a strong relationship based on respect,  bridging with confidence the worlds of  workplace and school.” Antoine Jeanpierre, IBM mentor  “My mentee was willing to prove  to me that he was able to honor his  commitments, on my side this experience  really challenges my manager posture.” Khadidiatou Ba Guisset, BNP Paribas mentor  11  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report “Technology for good? Yes but … not  without girls! This is Capital Fille’s ambition,  supported by Sanofi and more than 70  companies, so that girls from poorer  districts and rural areas can be trained on  digital skills and access jobs of the future.  In 2020, with the support of their teachers,  more than 12,000 girls will benefit from  Capital Fille’s activities.” Dominique Goutard, Capital Filles General Delegate  “Thanks to its global impact, Tech For Good  provides opportunities for many to benefit  from new technologies and be prepared for  tomorrow’s world. This year again, Thales  joins fellow companies to widen Tech For  Good’s scope with new initiatives for more  youngsters to be reached, wherever there  is a need.” Patrice Caine, Chairman and CEO of Thales  In March 2020, as the crisis intensified, the digital  platform Open P-TECH was launched. The goal is  to provide free digital learning on the tech skills of  tomorrow. This platform gathers in one place learning  on cutting-edge technology, engaging videos and  gamified assessments to spark and keep student  interest, and special resources for teachers. It is free to  schools, academic institutions, students and teachers  and offers industry-recognized digital badges. Open  P-TECH has already reached 30,000 students in 90  countries and expects to reach 150,000 students  by 2022. Open P-TECH is now available in English,  Spanish and Portuguese. Throughout the year, other  languages, including French, will follow. The plan is  to launch this initiative in France, with high-quality  French-speaking education contents accessible for  free to schools by the end of 2020.   The second major initiative is a Tech and Education  Alliance, created to scale the most successful  collective initiatives to promote tech education.  Companies including Thales, Accenture, Airbus,  Engie, IBM, and Sanofi joined forces within the  Alliance to encourage company collaboration around  significant STEM programs, develop and give free  access to pedagogical content and learning, and  increase students’ exposure to tech jobs and careers  opportunities by sharing employee testimonials.   Programs include initiatives in France, and around  the world, on cutting-edge technologies; pre- apprenticeship and online apprenticeship programs  (for example with the online French-education  provider OpenClassrooms); and actions focused on  girls and diversity (such as the STEM for Girls program  in India, with IBM and BNP Paribas, or Capital Filles in  France).   The Alliance’s aim is to reach 200 000 students by  2022.  12  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Initiatives launched   in 2020  To double down on their ambition, the Tech for  Education workstream members deployed two  additional initiatives in 2020 to tackle the critical issues  raised by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and to unlock the  full potential of EdTech in the future:  Objectif IA. This training course is provided by  OpenClassrooms in collaboration with Institut  Montaigne, a leading French think tank. The objective  is to make the subject of AI, its benefits and its  challenges, accessible to all. In the Tech for Good spirit  of reaching diverse populations, Objectif IA is targeted  at a non-expert audience and takes the form of a free  online training course delivered in French. The course  duration is five hours and it covers critical issues such  as AI myths, ethical and responsible AI, and the future  of work. The group ambition is that, by the next Tech  for Good Summit, more than 50,000 students will have  taken this class, and that this number will increase  to 650,000 by 2022. Objectif IA benefits from the  ongoing support of numerous companies, including  more than ten Tech for Good members—either French  companies or companies operating in France. They all  promote the course among their respective teams.  The EdTech Task Force. This special task force will  issue a short report outlining the main challenges  faced by EdTechs in France, and provide up to five  immediately actionable recommendations to foster  the development of the EdTech industry in France.  COVID-19 impact and  workstream’s actions Mid-April 2020, almost 200 countries had shut down  all their primary and secondary schools, affecting  almost 1.6 billion students.3 Where it was possible,  school authorities switched to remote learning with  successes but also with many challenges. However,  this shift has been uneven. Some systems were able  to train teachers, roll out remote learning, and put in  place student-support services in less than a week.  Others are still struggling, constrained by lack of  access to technology or expertise. The disparity is  evident between countries; it is also evident within  them—with a risk of increasing inequality.  If anything, this tragic crisis serves to reinforce the  importance of technology in areas such as digital  learning. However, addressing learning and outcome  inequities in a remote-learning environment is a  complex challenge as students’ vulnerability comes  in many forms: low-income students, immigrant  students, students with special needs, students in  remote rural areas, and those in risky home situations  all need tailored strategies and dedicated attention. In this context, the Tech for Education workstream has  been fully committed and active in its response to the  crisis.   During the French lockdown, Objectif IA began to offer  a free online AI training course. Numerous companies,  including 11 participants of the Tech for Good Summit,  joined forces to support the initiative, for example  by deploying it internally. The initiative has shown  success, as 18,000 people have already completed the  training.  During the crisis, Tech for Education members  launched several ad hoc initiatives, in addition to their  workstream engagements and corporate initiatives.  Many Tech for Good participants contributed greatly  during this time, and we acknowledge their efforts.   3  UNESCO website, https://en.unesco.org/.  13  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Here we highlight some of the actions the Tech for  Education workstream members launched to support  students, teachers, schools and education systems to  face the ongoing crisis:  Digital-learning equipment supply for needy  students, either directly or through NGOs (for  example, 3,000 computers and printers handed out by  BNP Paribas).  Remote coaching/tutoring sessions to support  students during the crisis.   To support high-school students in the crisis, Article  1, a Future of Work group member, launched the  #Réussitevirale coalition. The coalition was joined  by both BNP Paribas and Accenture. In particular,  Accenture consultants are involved to ensure the  application security while  consolidating the solution to become a long-term  platform to fight school dropout rates.  As presented in the Future of Work section, the crisis  may increase the need for skills of the future (including  technological skills). For this reason, IBM and Cisco,  an Economic Inclusiveness member, launched “digital  Fridays” with the Versailles Education authority to  offer online webinars for students covering topics such  as AI, quantum, cybersecurity and the future of work.   At the 2019 Tech for Good Summit the future  SkillsBuild digital platform designed to help  unemployed adults acquire the skills needed  for today’s jobs with personalized coaching was  announced. When the crisis occurred, IBM accelerated   its worldwide development with the goal of reaching  15,000 learners in 2020.   Tech solutions and tools to ensure learning continuity  and develop solutions for the future.   To ensure students’ learning continuity, education  providers added technical gateways to grant remote  access to curricula (for example, 95 percent of School  42 students were able to complete the curriculum  remotely).  While all schools and teachers were not fully equipped  to switch to remote learning, Tech for Education  members offered free e-learning platforms or  adapting business solutions for schools and students  (for example, 240,000 lessons were delivered free  to over 50 million students in March on Huawei’s  WeLink). To support the deployment of these  technologies within schools, members launched cross- company implementation actions (for example, IBM  and Cisco implementation of school distance-learning  tools with over 2,500 volunteers supporting 80,000  students in 13 EU countries).  In parallel, companies joined forces with international  organizations to find solutions to reduce the impact of  COVID-19 on our daily lives, focusing on education (for  example, IBM’s global “Code for Code” with the United  Nations). In particular, some group members (for  example, Huawei, IBM) joined the UNESCO coalition  for education to mobilize actors and resources,  coordinate action globally, match on-the-ground  needs with local and global solutions, and provide  distance education.  Participants Education (16)   14  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Future of Work  Co-chairs foreword:   COVID-19 and the future   of work  In the coming decade, workplace digitization and the  next wave of automation technologies will reshape how  our companies operate and how each of us will work. As  intelligent machines and other digital solutions become  fixtures in the workplace, we will need to develop new  skills and adopt new working modes. The need for some  skills, such as technological (+55 percent by 2030) as well  as social and emotional skills (+24 percent by 2030), will  rise, even as the demand for others, including physical  and manual skills, will fall.4 These changes will require  workers everywhere to deepen their existing skill sets or  acquire new ones. Companies, too, will need to rethink  how work is organized within their organizations.   During the 2019 Tech for Good Summit, participants  discussed how the future of work implies a skill-shift that  is both a business and a social imperative as technology,  including automation and artificial intelligence, is  expected to profoundly affect our lives. By 2030, an  estimated 375 million workers will have to switch  occupations or acquire new skills by 2030.  The ongoing situation is accelerating this transition  with the urgent need for workers and businesses to  fully integrate new technologies and address the new  normality.  But the COVID-19 pandemic is also putting hundreds  of millions of jobs and earning opportunities at risk,  including in sectors that were more susceptible to  automation over the longer term. In Europe only,  almost sixty million workers will be negatively impacted  (including reduction in hours or pay, temporary furloughs  or layoffs), with similar figures in the US.5 Facing the   unprecedented, companies have had to quickly adapt  how they operate to ensure employee’s health and  business continuity. Across sectors, working mode have  switched to remote working at a unique scale as digital  usage was skyrocketing. Undoubtedly, World is changing.  Business is changing. Work is changing.  Our societies and companies need to prepare for the  future. We need, collectively, to put workers on more  sustainable career paths, while ensuring the future of our  businesses by preparing the skill shift. Jobs of the future  will require skills of the future.  Through the Future of work group within Tech for Good,  Orange and Uber have found a unique platform for  discussion and initiatives building. With large companies,  NGOs and startups from different countries and sectors,  we were able to build common standards and design  training journeys towards skills of the Future. We would  like to thank all of them for their participation.

Members recognized and deployed a   common set of skills, while supporting JobReady’s  ambition of occupational integration by training  100,000 individuals in soft-skills by 2022. This  initiative was launched in 2019.   — Technological skills. Members defined a common   set of skills while developing internal and cross- companies use cases to train workers in these  skills. This initiative was launched in 2020 and  targets will be defined by the next Summit.  Progress on 2019 initiatives  on soft-skills  Workstream members have joined forces to promote  soft-skills through the following three major initiatives:  First, by signing and promoting a manifesto to their  partners. The manifesto, initiated by JobReady,  a member of the workstream, defines soft skills  and recognizes their importance—both within  organizations and for the future of the society. To date,  the manifesto has been signed by around 25 major  companies and JobReady’s ambition is to certify 5,000  individuals in soft skills by the next Summit, with the  support of the workstream members.  16  Second, by creating internal use cases based on the  common soft-skills definition. Among other projects,  Orange launched an internal pilot, CDiscount, and  RATP provided soft-skills training to their apprentice  communities while Sigfox trained their HR team on the  soft-skills taxonomy.  Third, by creating a cross-company partnership with  Uber and RATP to provide soft-skills certification to  ride-hailing drivers, enabling them to transition to new  contracts as bus drivers.   TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Initiatives launched   in 2020  Research indicates that demand for technological  competencies is the fastest-growing skills category,  and that these skills will be in high demand by 2030.  Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is expected to  accelerate this growth as technology usage increases.   Therefore Future of Work group members decided to  focus on technological skills in 2020 by creating the  following:  A common Charter (to be signed beyond the  workstream by the next Tech for Good Summit) to  align signatories’ ambition on:  — their intention to promote upskilling and reskilling   in technological skills as a business and a social  imperative,   — a list of the key technological skills, built with Uber,   Orange, Chance, Fitec and UiPath, to be used as  a basis to upskill and reskill employees with the  ambition to set a worldwide standard agreed upon  across countries and sectors.  Upskilling and reskilling journeys towards roles  requiring heavy technological skills. The group’s  ambition is to create internal and cross-company  training journeys on technological skills by next Tech  for Good Summit.  As of today, group members developed internal  training journeys, such as Orange’s 20,000 employees  to be trained by 2025 in network virtualization, AI,  data, cloud computing, coding and cyber security.  As part of its digital transformation plan, RATP aims  to develop the technological competences of its  63,000 employees with a focus on digital culture,  technology management and new working modes.  Other examples include CDiscount’s IT Masterclass  to train employees from various backgrounds to IT  positions or Uber’s initiative, in collaboration with  Openclassrooms, offering scholarships for Uber Eats  couriers to integrate a web-developer part-time  program combining studies and job.  Workstream members also developed cross-company  training journeys on technological skills. For example,  Fitec trains and certifies 2,400 people in various IT  solutions in both upskilling and reskilling programs.  With a lively community of more than 1,000 active  members on its marketplace, UiPath Connect,  and several thousands of downloads of the UiPath  Academy modules every year, UiPath is training a large  ecosystem of people in France in technological skills  (Robotic Process Automation).  During the lockdown, 8,000 jobseekers applied to  Openclassrooms’ 100 percent online training on  high-demand jobs and basic technological skills.  Through this Pole Emploi partnership, they will acquire  technological skills with a focus on 20 IT and system,  development and data jobs, including beginner and  expert levels, in order to fill the current skills gap in  French companies.  Complementary to those initiatives, the concept of  “which”-skilling emerged in the midst of the crisis.  “Which”-skilling can be defined as the process in  which a worker identifies his or her next professional  move prior to training for it or applying for it, leading  to productivity and performance increases as well  as turnover and absentia decreases. In addition, the  Future of Work group decided to involve Ma Voie,  a coalition of several Tech For Good members –  supported by Google.org – which includes Article1,  Bayes Impact, Chance and Generation. Ma Voie aims  at streamlining access to employment for all, and in  particular those affected by the current economic  downturn, by efficiently consolidating employment  services into a single service pipeline. This service  offers a personalized approach to job seekers and  offers participants confidence-raising tools. Ma Voie is  expected to support hundreds of job seekers as soon  as September 2020.  17  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report COVID-19 impact and  workstream’s actions  Even before the current crisis, changing technologies  and new ways of working were disrupting jobs and skill  requirements. The coronavirus pandemic is drastically  accelerating the urgency of this challenge.  Within the crisis, it has been observed that sectors  that are the most exposed (in terms of ability to  work remotely and ensure social distancing in the  workplace) also tend to be those with the highest  automation potential in the coming years, such as  retail, transport and storage, manufacturing and  construction. In these sectors, physical and manual  skills are over-represented while their overall demand  is expected to decrease by 2030. These are also the  occupations which usually require lower educational  qualifications and are often lower-paid jobs, with an  estimated 90 percent of jobs at risk providing earning  below median wage.6 The need for upskilling and  reskilling is therefore a social and business urgency.   The tragic context of the COVID-19 pandemic has led  many people to consider new career tracks. At the  workstream level, Chance experienced a doubling  of the number of applicants (8,000) for its career- guidance digital coaching service. Analysis show  that the increase comes mainly from three types of  profiles: people anticipating long-term downside  economic effects in their current sector, people  looking for more meaning in their position or a  better match between their roles and personalities,  and people looking for better employment security  such as freelance profiles. In light of this trend, the  Future of Work members are anticipating the need to  accompany workers’ transitions around the notion of  “which”-skilling.  Across industries, workers and corporate leaders must  figure out how they can adapt to rapidly changing  conditions and, in particular, how to ensure transition  to remote working and mitigate potential challenges.  Over the past weeks, remote working has drastically  increased. Organizations have been instructing staff  to continue working from home to ensure business  continuity while ensuring the rapid development of  remote-working capabilities. As an example, RATP  group, a workstream member, went from 1,500  employees working remotely one or two days per  week to 10,000 employees in full-time remote  working.   That said, embracing remote working poses serious  early-stage challenges for organizations across the  operating-model dimensions of people, structure,  process and technology, and leaders have an essential  role to play in developing solutions to term.7   In the post-crisis future, many organizations might  continue to leverage telecommuting. In a world  shaped by global competition, potential skill shortages,  and changing demographics, remote working could be  a key enabler for companies to deploy their workforce  more effectively and a competitive advantage to  attract a wide array of employees. As an example,  the Tech for Diversity workstream identified remote  working as the number-one opportunity for gender  diversity in the context. Corporate leaders also need to figure out how to  match the workforce with new roles and activities.  This is the reason why workstream members defined  the most efficient levers for organizations to adapt  their workforce and support their business partners.  This compendium has been shared with the Labor  Ministry to support policy decisions.

The  COVID-Over the past few months, we have all been  living through unprecedented demanding times. As  Corporate leaders, we have focused on solidarity,  safety, mutual care and inclusion to make sure our  teams worldwide persisted through this crisis in the  best possible way. Over the coming months, our  societies will face social crises giving rise to situations  of great human suffering, particularly for the most  vulnerable. In society as in our companies, the crisis  might challenge inclusion. However, we believe more  than ever that everyone is important and we therefore  wish to reaffirm our commitment to Tech for Diversity  and confirm that the Tech for Good Initiative was a  trailblazer. We are honored to co-lead the Diversity  work stream and, thanks to the remarkable work of all  its members, very proud of its achievements.   In 2019, 46 companies committed to reach 30 percent  of women in leadership positions worldwide. At  this date, one third achieved this goal. Also, twelve  companies committed to use technology to mitigate  bias and promote inclusion in hiring, promotions, and  pay equity, and have successfully adopted solutions in  order to enables this.  In 2020, despite the COVID-19 crisis, members of  the Tech for Diversity workstream are devotedly  continuing the work on new commitments aiming to  increase the number of women in tech roles and to  work with suppliers who promote diversity.   The Tech for Good initiative has become an  exceptional platform for our companies of all sizes  and backgrounds to come together, share their best  practices and join their forces for a common goal. We  want to take the opportunity of these few lines to  warmly thank all the Tech for Diversity members.   20  Along with L’Oréal and SAP, we are convinced that  the members of our Tech for Diversity group pride  themselves in supporting France’s endeavors while  contributing, at our own level, to a more equal and  inclusive world. We look forward to meeting in Paris at  the next Summit.   Jean-Paul Agon,   CEO L’Oréal Christian Klein,  CEO SAP  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Overall commitment  Companies in the Tech for Diversity workstream have  taken two commitments to increase gender diversity  in both leadership and tech roles:  — reaching 30 percent representation of women in   leadership positions by 2022 (taken in 2019),   — reaching 30 percent representation of women   in tech roles (timeframe to be defined and  commitment to be proposed for signature at the  next Summit).  Progress on 2019  commitment on women  in leadership  During the 2019 Tech for Good Summit, 46 tech and  non-tech companies made a commitment to reach  a target of 30 percent representation of women in  leadership positions within their organizations. By the  next Summit, new organizations are expected to join  the commitment. One year later, based on the status  updates received to date, we see that on average  companies improved their percentage of women in  leadership positions by 3.6 percentage points over the  year.8  Additionally, 21 companies have already reached the  30 percent goal—and some have exceeded it. For  example, three companies, Mozilla, L’Oréal and Solar  Impulse Foundation have now reached or maintained  50 percent representation of women in leadership  positions.   Among all potential levers to promote diversity,  gender diversity targets (36 percent) are considered  by the 46 signatories as the most efficient lever to  promote gender diversity within companies. The  effectiveness of this measure is confirmed by the  progress on the Women in leadership commitment, as  we observe that:   — companies that consider gender diversity as a   top-three strategic priority increased their gender  diversity by 5.3 percentage points in a year,   — companies that consider it is a top-ten priority   increased by 2.8 percentage points,   — companies that do not consider diversity as a   strategic priority decreased by −2.2 percentage  points.  Member companies indicated that other efficient  levers to promote diversity included active inclusion  (14 percent), recruitment initiatives (14 percent) and  debiasing promotions (7 percent).   In 2019, 12 companies in the workstream joined forces  in using technology pilot projects to promote diversity.  All of them fulfilled this commitment while other  companies from the workstream deployed their own  tech solutions with great impact. For example, Intel  reported an 82 percent success rate with an inclusive  retention tool. The Tech for Diversity workstream has  also become a best-practice sharing platform with  inspiring initiatives shared on a monthly basis.  8  Non-weighted average, based on companies reporting to Tech for Good and public information.  21  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Building on these successes, the workstream’s  ambition is now to expand and increase its impact  through new companies joining the commitment as  well as through new initiatives to promote gender  diversity in tech roles and beyond member companies’  organizations.   The list of the companies that reached 30 percent  representation of women in leadership will be  published on the occasion of the next Summit.  46 signatories  Accor Alibaba Atomico Bharti Enterprises Blablacar BNP Paribas Booking Cdiscount Dataiku  Deezer Deliveroo Doctolib Engie Ericsson  HPE IBM  Iliad La Poste  Linagora L’Oréal Malt Mirakl Mozilla  Open Classroom Orange OVH Qwant  RATP group Ripplewood Salesforce Sanofi  SAP Sinovation Ventures SNCF Sodexo Solar Impulse Foundation  Symphony  TF1 Thales Uber UiPath United Bank for Africa Upwork Visa Wynd YNSECT  22  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report initiatives on hold because of their response to the  pandemic.10 Tech for Diversity members and “Women  in leadership” signatories have identified recruitment  (44 percent), inclusion (15 percent), sponsorship  (8 percent) and revised diversity targets (8 percent) as  areas under threat.  However, research shows that leveraging I&D in the  crisis presents new opportunities as leaders and  companies that reaffirm their commitment to I&D can  seize the moment as they stretch for gains in five key  domains:    — Winning the war for talent by monitoring the   demographic profile of the workforce to ensure no  loss of diverse talent; the shift to remote working  could in fact offer an advantage with its benefits of  increased flexibility   — Improving the quality of decision making as  research has demonstrated that diverse teams  bring multiple perspectives to bear on a problem    — Increasing customer insight and innovation  as diverse teams have been shown to be more  innovative and stronger at anticipating shifts in  consumer needs and consumption patterns   — Driving employee motivation and satisfaction as   there is an opportunity to emphasize the critical  importance of inclusive leadership to ensure that  all employees feel included, valued, and motivated  in this context of increased vulnerability   — Improving a company’s global image and license  to operate as companies that maintain—or even  increase—their focus on I&D during the downturn  are likely to avoid the risk of being penalized in  its aftermath, for example by losing customers,  struggling to attract talent, and losing government  support and partnerships.11  2020 commitments  For the next Summit, the Tech for Diversity group aims  to do the following:   — take an additional commitment to reach a target  of 30 percent women in tech roles, in both tech  and non-tech companies. To date, 20 companies  are considering making this commitment, with  timeframe definition and final signature expected  during the next Summit.   — promote diversity within member organizations’   ecosystems, for example by working with suppliers  and vendors and other key business stakeholders  to promote diversity in the value chain.  After having focused on gender equity as a first step,  the Tech for Diversity workstream is planning to  expand its scope of work in 2021 to other key topics  in diversity and inclusion. This will include topics such  as equal opportunities and inclusion in the workplace  for people from different multicultural and socio- economic origins.  COVID-19 impact and  workstream’s actions  COVID-19 has caused worldwide disruption and the  impact on women has been particularly pronounced.  Women are over-represented in some of the  most exposed sectors; for instance, 70 percent of  healthcare professionals are women. There has also  been an increase in domestic violence in France by up  to 30 percent during the lockdown.  Moreover, the lessons from previous crises show that  there is a very real risk that inclusion and diversity  (I&D) efforts may recede as a strategic priority for  organizations at this time as they focus on more  pressing basic needs.9 Early signs this time around  are not encouraging.

Many group members indicate that  they consider the ongoing situation as an opportunity  for gender diversity as the crisis has led to more  flexible working (78 percent) and greater inclusion  between employees (8 percent). When asked about  the expected change on Diversity ambition as a result   of the COVID-19 crisis, surveyed companies indicate  that they expect either no change (56 percent) or  gender diversity to become even more important  (30 percent).  To mitigate the potential negative impact of the  COVID-19 crisis on women, while ensuring that gender  diversity is part of the recovery phase, 22 companies  are considering signing a new commitment to be  released ahead of the Summit.  Participants Diversity (15)  © Présidence de la République française  24  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for   Economic  Inclusiveness  Co-chair’s foreword:  Leveraging technology   to decrease inequalities  We believe that reducing inequality and improving  economic inclusion is one of the most important  challenges of our time. In particular, we are convinced  that the digital divide is a fundamental issue. While  technology should be a lever for inclusion, for millions  of people it is a factor of exclusion. For instance, in  France alone, 13 million people are struggling with  digital, of which 7 million have no equipment and  therefore no access to internet.12 The need for action  has become even more urgent due to the COVID- 19 crisis. With more than 4 billion people confined  worldwide and 1.5 billion children affected by school  closures as of April 2020,13 inequalities resulting from  digital exclusion have been reinforced, severely  impacting families, work, education and social  interactions.  Digital inclusion has long been a priority for La  Poste and Samsung, and we know this concern is  shared by the rest of the members of the Tech for  Economic Inclusiveness coalition: BPI France, Cisco,  Ericsson, La Française des Jeux, Generation, Linagora,  Malt, McKinsey, Mirakl, One Web, OPTIC, Simplon,  Sinovation Ventures, and Symphony.   We have collectively decided to set ourselves three  objectives: bridging the digital divide, training our  ecosystem and fostering innovative startups and  solutions. We would like to celebrate the collaborative  action of all members which has led to the creation of  numerous initiatives.  The objective of our coalition now is to scale-up these  actions. We believe that together we can contribute to  impactful changes for the excluded populations.

A digitally empowered member of an ecosystem:  — has access to affordable equipment,  — is trained to master the capabilities needed to use   digital tools,   — has access to innovative digital services and tech   solutions.  As a group, the workstream can have significant  impact. In 2019, the companies in this workstream  represented approximately 750,000 employees  and hundreds of millions of consumers, and had  a combined turnover of more than $275 billion.  Members of the Tech for Economic Inclusiveness  group consider it imperative to build significant impact  and to deploy initiatives at scale, using their networks,  resources and wide range of capabilities.  By 2025, the group’s targets are to digitally empower  the following:  — one million people in France,  — five million people worldwide.  With these targets, the group commits to reinforce  and complete the ambition of the French government  in terms of digital inclusion. In particular, the French  State has implemented the “Pass Numérique” initiative  which gives beneficiaries the right to access—in  pre-qualified locations—to digital support services,  with total or partial coverage by a third-party payer,  and aims at reaching one million people by 2022.  The following development needs regarding the  Pass Numérique have been identified: identification  of people in need, marketing and upgrading of the  offer with additional training programs, geographical  expansion, and financial support.  © Présidence de la République française  26  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Progress on initiatives  Together, the members of Tech for Economic  Inclusiveness have launched dozens of concrete  actions to promote digital inclusion. They have  developed actions to face challenges brought by the  COVID-19 crisis, such as providing access to electronic  equipment to facilitate remote working and schooling,  and developing a platform to facilitate the sourcing of  critical products. The members are also progressing  on actions that are intended to have impact in the  medium and long term to digitally equip excluded  people, provide training throughout ecosystems  and foster digital solutions. Some of them include  an infrastructure effort in 3GPP standardization led  by Ericsson, a project to connect every school in  the world by One Web, Malt’s peer-to-peer learning  academies, and the Accelerator Seine-Saint-Denis  hosted by BPI France that creates opportunities in  marginalized communities.  Looking forward, to achieve its overall commitment,  the group decided to join efforts to scale up six of  the existing long-term concrete activities. Each  member of the group is currently considering how its  organization can contribute to the development of  these six actions, given its strengths and capabilities.  These actions have already achieved a strong positive  impact:    — Connect To Learn is a global education initiative,   co-founded by Ericsson, with the purpose of  improving access to quality education for all  children through the use of broadband and ICT. By  the end of 2019, more than 180,000 students had  benefited from the program across 25 countries.   — Digital Inclusion by La Poste aims to foster   social, digital and banking inclusion of individuals  suffering from “illectronism”. The program  identifies digitally precarious clients when helping  them use digital tools—such as automatic teller  machines and websites—and offers them training  from partner associations. As of May 2020, the  program has supported 42,000 people in France  with a 95 percent satisfaction rate.   — Digital Factories by Simplon builds free, inclusive   training in digital skills. Training is provided to  underserved communities and/or employees  directly or indirectly impacted by the digital  transformation. The Digital Factories initiative—   a network of more than 100 centers located  in more than 20 countries—has trained 8,000  adults, mostly with no or a low diploma, including  40 percent women, and educated approximately  150,000 young people across the world since 2014,  and aims to train 10,000 people a year by 2022.   — The Networking Academy led by Cisco   provides free online training and employment  opportunities. Up to 2.15 million students enrolled  last year from more than 12,000 locations globally.   — Generation is an independent non-profit founded  by McKinsey. Since launching operations in 2015,  Generation has recruited, trained, and placed  youth in jobs, with 37,000 graduates globally in  13 countries across 26 professions.    — The Extreme Tech Challenge (XTC) is a non-  profit organization inspired by the United Nations  17 Sustainable Development Goals, and comprising  more than 30 partners, including Samsung, Cisco,  Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom, and NXP. The XTC  hosts and runs the world’s largest global startups  competition which selects entrepreneurial  ventures that utilize technology to address global  challenges, and raises the investment potential  for these companies. In 2019 and 2020, the XTC  facilitated 11 regional events in 10 countries across  Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia. Over  2,400 startups from 87 countries have applied for  the XTC 2020 global competition. The competition  has also added two additional tracks to select the  top COVID-19 Innovator and Female Founder’s  startups. The global finals are due to be held on  July 15, 2020.  Several potential partnerships between Tech for  Economic Inclusiveness members are currently being  discussed to achieve the desired scale-up of these  concrete actions.  27  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report COVID-19 impact and  workstream’s actions Members of the Tech for Economic Inclusiveness  group have been active in their response to the crisis,  particularly in mobilizing to increase access to digital  services—much needed at this difficult time—and to  reduce inequality, increase economic inclusion, and  provide support for communities.   Many Tech for Good companies took action in this  regard and we acknowledge their efforts. As of May  2020, Tech for Economic Inclusiveness members have  taken the following concrete actions in a variety of  areas:  Providing access to electronic equipment to facilitate  remote working, home schooling and support  communities. Examples include making solutions  available for free (free video-conferencing and cyber- security solutions by Cisco, free software by Symphony  for 70,000 beneficiaries, and a free open-source  Work@Home platform by Linagora), distributing  equipment to enable home schooling (secure  distribution of 10,000 laptops available in schools to  unequipped families and free sending and digitization  of 6,000 pieces of homework every day since April  20 by La Poste) and providing equipment to allow  patients to keep in touch with their loved ones (more  than 20,000 pieces of equipment were delivered all  over France by the #GardonsLeLien coalition initiated  by Isabelle Kocher and Carlo Purassanta (Microsoft  France) and led by the Simplon Foundation).  Participants EI (15)  Training ecosystems by offering online training to  pupils and teachers (Cisco and partners hosted online  webinars for pupils and teachers), to the medical  staff (Generation developed short online courses for  medical and non-medical staff for COVID-19 upskilling  needs, which have been launched in Italy with 51,453  nurses and 12,020 doctors and dentists enrolled thus  far, Mexico, and India and are being created in Spain,  France, and Pakistan) and to the general public (Malt  Academy offered free masterclasses to 15,000 people  in France, Spain, and Germany).  Fostering innovative digital services and solutions to  support the healthcare sector (examples include The  StopCovid19.fr platform, by Mirakl, which facilitates  the sourcing of critical products, including 20 million  masks and 840,000 liters of hydroalcoholic gel as of  May 2020; the ‘masques-pme’ platform by La Poste  dedicated to ordering masks; and #readytohelp by  Malt to offer tech expertise to health organizations.  Docaposte contributed to the self-assessment solution  MaladieCoronavirus.fr, which is the most widely  used e-health web application in France with eight  million users), support open research efforts (Ericsson  supported open research efforts by national and  governmental organizations) and ensure long-term  ethical reflection (Samsung and Optic ensured long- term ethical reflection on data usage by companies  and governments, in particular for contact tracing).  28  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for  Environment  Co-chair’s foreword:  Sustainability and  technology  Faced with several threats due to mankind’s impact on  the environment, and in particular climate change, our  companies are rethinking the way we do business to  deliver the greatest impact for people, prosperity and  the planet.   Support to act in this direction comes from  consumers, civil society and is reflected in government  regulations, but is also a collective desire from within  our companies, and a priority for our employees and  investors alike.   Both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Engie are  working to reduce the carbon footprint from our  business activities and to provide our customers  with more sustainable and low-carbon products  and services. We are committed to reducing the  environmental impacts from not only our operations,  but also from the customer use of our products and  services and from our supply chain.  Sustainability is good for business. Having a positive  contribution to the environment and addressing  climate change enables us to create new sources of  value and to become more resilient to threats in the  long run.   While the digital carbon footprint must be properly  monitored, it is also important to keep in mind that  digital innovation is a critical component on the  sustainability roadmap, contributing to the needed  reduction of consumption of natural resources. This spirit drives the activity of the Tech for  Environment workstream that we co-chair.   We are convinced economic performance goes hand  in hand with having a positive impact on people and  on the planet. It is thanks to the strong involvement  and collaboration from members of our group that  we are able to share our initiatives with you, just one  year after the launch of Tech for Environment. Enjoy  reading!  Claire Waysand,   Interim CEO Engie Antonio Neri,   President & CEO Hewlett Packard Enterprise  29  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Overall commitment  The companies in the Tech for Environment workstream  believe that addressing climate change is the most  urgent environmental challenge and that drastic  reduction of emissions is needed across all sectors.  To stabilize the climate, emissions would need to decline  by approximately 50 percent by 2030 and reach net  zero by 2050. Under the Paris Agreement, governments  around the world committed to keeping the increase in  global average temperature to well below 2°C, and to  reduce global emissions.  Therefore, the ambition and overall commitment  of the Tech for Environment coalition is to decrease  greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris  Agreement.  Initiatives launched in 2020  Companies in this workstream have identified the  following three initiatives to reach their goals:  Disclosing and monitoring greenhouse gas  emissions. This initiative aims to create transparency  on greenhouse gas emissions and set reduction targets  aligned with the Paris Agreement. The objective is to  have 100 percent of the large companies participating  in Tech for Good engaged in disclosing scopes 1 to 3 of  greenhouse gas emissions (via the Carbon Disclosure  Project initiative), setting aspirational reduction  targets on greenhouse gas emissions (by committing  to the Science Based Targets initiative) and increasing  the use of zero-carbon energy (through the RE100  initiative) by 2022.  Reducing the tech carbon footprint, in particular  the data carbon footprint. As of November 2019, the  digital sector was responsible for 4 percent of global  greenhouse gas emissions and the strong increase  in use suggests a doubling of this carbon footprint  by 2025.14 This initiative includes two concrete  actions: decarbonizing data centers, and building an  educational campaign for consumers and employees  aimed at reducing the data-usage footprint.   14  “La face cachée du numérique,” ADEME, ademe.fr.  30  The goal is to reach one million individuals through  this campaign by the next Summit and ten million  individuals by 2022.  Leveraging and promoting tech to decrease the  global environmental footprint. The group believes  that technology is a great enabler of the ecological  transition. Therefore this initiative fosters green  tech solutions that are currently being developed by  startups. Solar Impulse Foundation, Hello Tomorrow  and the Ministry for the Ecological Transition have  compiled a catalogue of such solutions. The group  proposes that Tech for Good companies select  solutions that they are interested in, partner with  their founders, and accelerate the solutions via the  implementation of pilot projects. The group’s ambition  is to enable two pilots of green tech solutions by 2020  and ten by 2022.  Furthermore, during the 2019 Tech for Good Summit,  Tech for Environment CEOs highlighted that moving  towards zero waste to landfill is a priority. Therefore  the workstream will launch an initiative regarding zero  waste to landfill (including considerations for e-waste)  during the next Tech for Good Summit.  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report The members of Tech for Environment will continue  to work together to be able to define concrete actions  to achieve their objectives and track progress against  critical metrics. The group believes that taking action  on environmental issues is an opportunity to make  a difference in mindsets and, in time, to change the  world.   COVID-19 impact and  workstream’s actions  Members of the Tech for Environment workstream  have been analyzing how to participate in a “green  recovery” from the current crisis. The group believes  that it is essential to take climate change into account  in post-crisis reconstruction decisions. The crisis may  in fact open opportunities for changing behavior  towards more environmentally friendly ways of  working, for example taking fewer flights, buying more  locally produced goods and reducing consumption. Two areas for action have been identified and, as of  May 2020, are still being analyzed:    — launching a Tech for Good petition to motivate   for the inclusion of climate change priorities in all  recovery discussions,   — engaging with the different committees in charge   of reflections on climate change (for example,  Citizens convention for ecological transition and  Green Deal)15 with regards to including more  impactful measures in line with the French and EU  policy makers’ priorities on sustainability in the  workstream’s activity.  Environment (15)  Participants  15  The Citizens’ Convention is a democratic experiment in France during which 149 proposals have been defined by 150 citizens to achieve a reduction of at   least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  31  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Introducing   new reflections  32  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for Good should be about both proactively doing  good and avoiding “tech for bad”, that is, mitigating  potential tech risks. Technology has the potential to  help tackle some of the world’s most challenging social  problems, but it can also generate negative effects  on society and, because of its massive and rapid  development, sometimes poses new challenges and  risks.   France and Europe can become leaders on the use  of technology for inclusive growth and accountable  technology, as shown by the impactful activity of  VivaTech and the French Tech for Good ecosystem.  The African continent is positioning itself at the  forefront of a new technological emergence, whereby  cross-fertilization of projects and ideas arise. As a  network representing the African Tech ecosystem,   Digital Africa contributes to this movement by  highlighting and fostering the most promising projects  in the field, while offering an acute perspective on the  African entrepreneurs ecosystem and the COVID-19  impact. Business leaders have an essential role to play  and our aim is to further engage member companies  in new discussions: the AI for Good workstream  will be launched to identify opportunities where AI  can address critical humanitarian challenges, and  the Accountable Tech theme will find ways to help  mitigate tech risks when they exist. Reflecting on  the role of tech after the crisis and ensuring that it  contributes to the common good will remain a priority  of the French Presidency after the crisis, when the  focus will expand to rebuilding a stronger and fairer  innovation-enabled economy.  \\u2003  © Présidence de la République française  33  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for Good ecosystem  Tech for Good France  foreword FOR A BROADER AND MORE AMBITIOUS VISION  OF TECH FOR GOOD  Scientific research, technological innovation,  economics and entrepreneurship are powerful  levers for addressing our global challenges by  developing innovations that offer actionable  responses to the major issues we face as societies.  For nearly 10 years now, a host of agile and creative  non-profits, startups, collectives and innovation  centers have been part of a far-reaching movement  that seeks to place innovation, technology and the  economy at the service of the common good. The  recent health and social crises have shown just how  quickly these structures and ecosystems can provide  solutions for society’s most basic needs (such as  health and education). In the coming months and  years, other issues (the climate emergency) and crises  (environmental and possibly economic) will accelerate  the transition towards new social, economic and   environmental frameworks (in this respect, the UN’s  17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)16 are already  widely shared by the sector actors’). “Tech for Good”  has become one of the driving sectors of the economy,  with the creation of new organizational and service  models. A recent report from the Good Tech Lab  (October 2019)17 claims that, by 2030, tech and deep  tech solutions in response to the SDGs could represent  a sector worth $12 trillion and employing 380 million  people worldwide. Science and emerging technologies  such as synthetic biology or nanomaterials are  key enablers to shift our industries towards more  sustainable models. For example, 97% of deep  tech startups selected though the Hello Tomorrow  Challenge are targeting some SDGs, especially those  related to healthcare (51%) and environmental issues  (40%).  16  https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ 17  Good Tech Lab report: The Frontiers of Impact Tech: the opportunities and challenges of Impact Tech across the 17 Global Goals, (October 2019).  34  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report  — Train and encourage a “for good” generation,   through the promotion of “for good” careers in  university and supporting the development and  activities of incubators, accelerators, innovation  spaces and dedicated events;   — Create a “Tech for Good” label building on the   typology elaborated by the network.   Following on from the two Tech for Good Summits and  the initiatives they inspired, France and Europe must  now make an even stronger contribution to structuring  and developing the sector, in close cooperation with  sector collectives and ecosystems, and also with all  of the international economic actors. With a single  imperative: to respond collectively and rapidly to the  major social, environmental, economic and industrial  challenges of the coming decade.  Today, Tech for Good goes far beyond the scope of  entrepreneurship and the ecosystems of startups  and nonprofits: it is also a vector of transition and  transformation for public services, major corporations  and industrial firms, with a potential for fast large- scale impact.   Tech for Good can’t be limited to taking  “compensatory” measures. It must act as a catalyst to  update our models through renovated and responsible  approaches, so as to instill an obsession for “change  for good” into them. But this will not be possible  without a deeper transformation of a number of  historical paradigms: the ways in which economic and  industrial actors collaborate with ecosystem actors;  the short-term scope businesses typically rely upon  (most Tech for Good projects develop over a longer  timeframe); questions of governance (the place of  employees and users in decision-making processes)  and over the sharing of collectively produced value.  The “for good” promise needs to lie at the core of the  companies’ organizational and business models.18  SECTORAL CHALLENGES TO BE ADDRESSED  To meet these transformation challenges, it is now  vital that we disseminate and support an ambitious  vision of Tech for Good. And it is urgent for all of us to  contribute to building a French and European Tech for  Good sector with massive support from government  and private actors. This strategy could be based on a  set of concrete measures and actions, such as:   — Create funding levers and structures (public,   private, and hybrid) to foster burgeoning  companies, nonprofits and activities by factoring  their impact into the evaluation criteria for  awarding subsidies and funds;   — Promote multi-actor projects, in particular those   that involve structures such as startups, SMEs,  midcaps and/or large groups (e.g. economic and  industrial partnerships, co-innovation of services,  cross-business synergies);  18  On this subject, see the manifesto co-authored by the entrepreneurs of the Tech For Good France network, with a vision of Tech for Good that is closely  related to that of “Good in Tech“ through its insistence on the need to adopt an ethical, inclusive, ecological approach that prioritizes the sharing of value  and wealth: https://www.techforgoodfr.org/manifeste/  35  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for Good France  ecosystem  While the Tech for Good workstreams are composed  of a mix of large companies, investment funds, NGOs  and startups, the following section offers an additional  outlook on the initiatives led by the French “for good”  startup ecosystem.  The Tech for Good France network supports more  than 200 organizations, including entrepreneurs and  start-ups (for example, Bayes Impact, AssoConnect,  Data for Good), financiers and impact investing players  (for example, Seed makesense, Citizen Capital, Raise  Impact) as well as other networks supporting the  development of the sector and developing multi- actor innovation programs with large groups and  public institutions (for example, Liberté Living-lab,  makesense, Schoolab, Hello Tomorrow).   Tech for Good France network main missions are to:  — Structure the Tech For Good ecosystem;  — Publish a White Paper covering best practices  of entrepreneurs in terms of SDO resolution,  innovation, governance, and environmental  commitment;   — Launch public advocacy actions;   — Organize a digital training program for   entrepreneurs.  2020-2021 ECOSYSTEM ACTIONS Over the past few months, several Tech for Good  french startups have built new services to address  urgent issues: preventing and helping cure diseases  (Nabla, Continuum), helping vulnerable people to  access to essential goods (Banlieues Santé, Entourage),  fostering circular economy and sustainable food  system (Phenix, Castalie, HelloZack). Another big  challenge is to combine technological innovation with  sustainability by developing clean energies and green  IT solutions (Datafarm, Ilek, Naoden).   In order to support transformation of companies  towards impact business models and services, some  players of the ecosystem have developed multi-actors  projects (including large groups, startups and public  institutions). For example, in early 2020, Liberté   36  Living-lab kicked off the “Shift Lab” program to guide  companies in their alignment of tech, economic  performance and socio-environmental impact. MoHo  has launched two international coalitions, “Deplastify”  with UC Berkeley, to find innovative solutions to  reduce impacts of plastic and “AI for Humanity” to  leverage AI to solve Health or Agritech challenges.  Another illustration of the dynamism of the Tech for  Good scene is the rise of events such as ChangeNow  Summit (20,000 visitors in 2020) or Hello Tomorrow  Summit; and dedicated massive venues where all  stakeholders can collaborate to initiate and accelerate  positive impact projects. Norrsken, in Stockholm and  soon to be in Rwanda, is hosting daily more than 400  changemakers and financing startups to build impact  unicorns. In Normandy (France), MoHo will open early  2021 the first “Collider” in Europe to recreate the  coalition spirit of WW2 D-Day: 1000+ changemakers  from all over the world will be hosted to tackle the  most pressing challenges faced today.  SELECTED ACTIONS RELATED TO COVID-19 The ecosystem’s players have developed solutions to  deal with the crisis.   Initiatives have helped healthcare professionals  control the pandemic. In a context of strong pressure  on the emergency services, the Liberté Living-lab  (LLL) developed a real-time flow management tool  alongside the Paris Public Hospital (AP-HP).  To provide caregivers with protective equipment  (masks, gloves), Tech for Good France handled the  collection of donations launched by the Protège ton  Soignant movement, which raised seven million euros.  To further support them, makesense launched the  Re.action program, which trained 5,000 volunteers to  help the hospitals.  Tech For Good players have developed actions to  bridge the digital divide that affects the most fragile  individuals and companies. For example, more than  20,000 pieces of equipment were delivered all over  France by the #GardonsLeLien coalition allowing  150,000 COVID19 patients and elder residents to   TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report keep in touch with their loved ones. Schoolab has  launched a free program to support small and medium  businesses in their digital transformation so that they  can operate during lockdown.  In a global approach, the “HackingCovid19”  hackathon brought together 1,400 participants in  April to work on 102 projects, some of them are now  accompanied by Schoolab.  The ecosystem has supported impact entrepreneurs  by accompanying them on their urgent needs (TEKHNE  program from Liberté Living Lab) and by setting up a  free Help Room (Tech for Good France).  Participants Startups (6)  © Présidence de la République française  37  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report VivaTech’s perspective  on COVID-19 impact on  startups  The startup ecosystem has been hit hard by the Covid- 19 crisis, in particular by the collapse of the sales  and funding pipeline, which has resulted in major  cash flow issues. Yet European startups have been  resilient. They have shown exemplary responsiveness  and agility, putting the test-and-learn process  into action, to adapt their working methods and  upgrade their offerings, going as far as to pivot when  necessary. Some have thus been able to seize the new  opportunities created by the rapid evolution of digital  practices and the multiplication of collaborations  with large companies, with the public sector or with  other startups, in various fields (cybersecurity, health,  productivity tools, online education...).  Given the difficult circumstances, we must salute  the solidarity startups have shown as they mobilize  to face the emergency. Some of them, like Doctolib  (telemedicine) and OpenClassrooms (e-education),  provided free access to their tools. Others, such as  Blablacar, Mirakl and collectives such as “Protège ton  soignant” (Protect your caregiver), have developed  new services to promote intergenerational solidarity  or simplify the supply of medical equipment. The crisis is inadvertently giving rise to a unique  opportunity for in-depth transformation of business  models in light of the upheavals, both economic and  societal, that it generates. Companies are indeed being  encouraged by all of their stakeholders to rethink their  mission and their organizations in order to contribute  to the common good.  VivaTech, Europe’s biggest startup and tech event,  wants to contribute to this sea change. We have  been committed since our inception to harnessing  the power of innovation for a more sustainable,  inclusive, responsible and resilient world. We call  on all stakeholders in the ecosystem to participate  and collaborate to give meaning to technological  innovations. It’s everyone’s business, not just of  those already doing good by design. This is why we  have created a cycle of conferences lasting several  days, to be inspired by those who are redefining  the boundaries; we have designed thematic spaces  to discover the most promising innovations to  preserve our planet or promote inclusion; and we  have imagined start-up prizes to encourage female  entrepreneurship or accelerate the ecological  transition by connecting them to business partners  and investors.  Collectively, let’s put innovation at the service of  societal and environmental challenges and accelerate  the emergence of digital champions in Europe,  pioneers of this transformation. Our mission is more  relevant than ever and it will be at the heart of both  the 2021 edition of VivaTech and the Tech for Good  Summit.    38  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Tech for Good in Africa  Digital Africa  The Digital Africa initiative, launched by President  Macron in 2018, envisions digital transformation from  the standpoint in which technology is intrinsically “for  Good.” Breakthrough innovations driven by African  tech entrepreneurs from all over the continent are  now improving quality of life, supporting the real  economy, and gradually becoming solutions for the  rest of the world.  By supporting entrepreneurial endeavors and  innovation players from local ecosystems, Digital  Africa fosters resilient, frugal and inclusive innovations  that contribute to the sustainable development goals,  including access to education, jobs, health, and other  essential services. This emerging model of innovation  from the global south takes into account the limits  encountered by historic technological players in  industrialized countries such as negative carbon  footprint, lack of diversity, and growing inequalities.  COVID-19 impact on African  entrepreneurs  The COVID-19 pandemic has significant economic  and sanitary implications for the African continent.  It puts a stress on the resilience of local digital and  entrepreneurial ecosystems.  The African Union (AU) forecasts a negative growth of  −0.9 percent owing to the effects of the crisis. These  include disruptions in trade flows from the European  Union, United States and China, as well as reductions  in remittances from the diaspora, foreign direct  investments, and illicit financial flows. Furthermore,  the AU expects falling commodity prices and a  decrease in the demand for exports (such as oil, rice,  mineral ores and metals) to affect both production and  revenues. Adding to these impacts are the tangible  realities of increasing mortality rates, decreases in tax  revenue and increases in public spending.  39  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report These projections paint an even harsher reality for  businesses and the micro, small and medium-size  enterprises (MSMEs) that make up a significant  part of many African economies. According to the  International Labour Organization, the informal sector  in sub-Saharan Africa accounts for over 89 percent  of all employment. MSMEs represent 38 percent of  the region’s GDP, and were already facing challenges  before the pandemic linked to access to finance   (a $331 billion gap), access to international markets,  or access to support structures.  Digital Africa in collaboration with the I4Policy  Foundation, AFD, Briter, Enabel, Facebook and GIZ  launched a continent-wide survey of entrepreneurs  to quantify and assess the impact on African  entrepreneurs and assess policy measures and  interventions in place to support them. The MSME  survey was conducted across 46 African countries  and addressed mainly projects in the sector of  telecommunications and tech, but also in agriculture  and education.  Key figures regarding the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic on African startups highlight that nearly  half of them were at risk of failure, while 40 percent  said they had enough operating capital to sustain  themselves for the next three months. As two-thirds  of the respondents reported losses in revenue,  temporary closures were also expected. The biggest   need that was expressed was, unsurprisingly, the  need for capital support (89 percent), and the main  challenges remain access to finance, access to markets  and business support. As a result of COVID-19 crisis  measures, 37 percent of MSMEs have had to reduce  working hours, and 18 percent have had to reduce  employees’ pay. Overall, employment fell by an  average of 18 percent for MSMEs.  Nevertheless, it is important to underline that some  MSMEs (about 17 percent) have also been positively  affected by the effects of the pandemic. For instance,  sectors such as fintech are exploding in a quarantined  world as cashless payments are increasing as part of  social-distancing measures.  An overwhelming majority of MSMEs believe that  entrepreneurs, artists, and other innovators have  ideas and solutions that can contribute to the  response and recovery of this pandemic. In fact, some  of them were quick to react, and 62 percent of the  actors surveyed are already implementing COVID-19- related initiatives either within their organization or  with other organizations.    40  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report AI for Good  AI capabilities have the potential to help tackle some  of the world’s most challenging social problems. Many  aspects of AI opportunities for social good are already  addressed by the existing workstreams. To bring a  new perspective and focus on critical humanitarian  challenges, we will launch the AI for Good workstream  by the next Summit.  Applying the tremendous  capabilities of AI to tackle  humanitarian challenges  Many AI capabilities, primarily in the categories  of computer vision, natural language processing,  structured deep learning, robust IoT and cyber- physical networks or new generation robotics, can  enable large-scale social impact. This social value  can be analyzed and targeted towards humanitarian  challenges within ten impact areas (Exhibit 3).19     One of the concerns of Tech for Good initiatives is to  promote equality and inclusion by fighting the digital  divide. However, it is worth noting that connectivity  keeps growing worldwide, including in emerging  economies. There are many AI-based tech initiatives  that could further social good, for example by leading  to more efficient functioning of local markets,  and providing access to micro-credit and cheaper  payment systems. Access to trusted digital identities  are also key to legal empowerment of marginalized  communities. The development of public utilities  and new public and social services in under-served  communities could now be enabled through basic  mobile phones thanks to AI. These advances could all  become a core reflection of AI for Good. Leveraging the capabilities of AI for social good is  already embedded in the reflection of the existing  workstreams. The Tech for Education workstream, for  instance, has launched a dedicated initiative this year.  The objective of the AI for Good workstream will be to  provide a new perspective, focusing particularly on the  potential of AI to tackle humanitarian challenges that  are not yet addressed.   19   “Notes from the AI frontier: Applying AI for social good”, Discussion paper, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2018, McKinsey.com.  41  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Exhibit 3  Use cases leveraging Ai capabitylities can be categorized within ten impact areas  Number of use cases per domain   Security and justice  Harm prevention  Fair prosecution  Policing  Public and social sector  Effective management of public sector  Effective management of social sector  Fundraising  Public finance management  Services to citizens  Infrastructure  Energy   Real estate  Transportation  Urban planning  Water and waste management  Information verification and validation  False news  Polarization  Health and hunger  Treatment delivery  Prediction and prevention  Treatment and long-term care  Mental wellness  Hunger   17  16  15  16  15  13  21  4  11  28   Crisis response  Disease outbreak  Migration crises  Natural and man-made disasters  Search and rescue   Economic empowerment  Agricultural quality and yield  Financial inclusion  Initiatives for economic growth  Labor supply and demand matching   Education  Access and completion of education  Maximizing student achievement  Teacher and administration productivity   Environment  Animal and plant conservation  Climate change and adaptation  Energy efficiency and sustainability  Land, air, and water conservation   Equality and inclusion  Accessibility and disabilities  Exploitation  Marginalized communities  Note: Research into areas where AI is already being used for broad social impact reveals roughly 160 use cases, all touching on some aspect of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Source: Notes from the AI frontier: Applying AI for social good, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2018 – McKinsey Global Institute analysis   To launch the reflection, companies will reflect  on the main challenges as well as the key success  factors in ensuring the successful application of AI  for humanitarian good at scale. Companies will also  discuss potential solution spaces, leveraging examples  of successful use cases.  Bottlenecks limiting the use  of AI for humanitarian good  at scale  While there are many AI use cases worldwide, few  have achieved impact at scale. The most significant  bottlenecks to scaling solutions are data accessibility,  a shortage of talent to develop AI solutions, and “last  mile” implementation challenges. Data needed for social impact uses may not be  easily accessible. A wide range of stakeholders own,  control, collect, or generate the data that could   be deployed for AI solutions. These data sets may  contain highly confidential personal data that needs  to be anonymized. Obtaining access to them by social  entrepreneurs and NGOs can be difficult because of  regulations on privacy and risks concerns.   Furthermore, the expert AI talent needed to develop  and train AI models is in short supply. Problem  complexity increases significantly where use cases rely  on several AI capabilities to work together cohesively  and require multiple different data-type inputs.  Other “last mile” implementation challenges, such as  change management that includes adapting processes  to integrate AI-powered solutions, are major  obstacles.  Innovations are multiplying in different sectors  and branches of AI, and they take place in a very  competitive and technologically complex context.  The non-commercial and humanitarian sector is  not necessarily placed on an equal footing with the  industrial or service economy.  42  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report The complexity of technologies, the development of  relevant algorithms, the capacity to access relevant  quality data, and the ethical analysis of their potential  but also of their limits, are based on the prerequisites  of digital infrastructures, data heritage and advanced  human skills, which are still rare and therefore  expensive.  The sustainable adoption and dissemination of AI  technologies can be achieved within the framework  of a global digital transformation. This would require  decision and action, with clearly defined steps and a  long-term investment perspective.  In order to remove obstacles, public authorities and  companies will need to cooperate to successfully  launch and maintain AI-based humanitarian projects.  Public authorities could even more develop and  contribute their infrastructure skills to support  humanitarian causes. Companies could contribute by  revising their corporate social responsibility programs.   In this way, public structures could take over a  substantial part of the selection, digital formatting  and preparation of public data useful for humanitarian  action. Where this data is held by private actors, they  could make it available free of charge, or at cost price,  for the benefit of humanitarian projects. They could  also contribute in kind, with computing capacity or  right of access to their infrastructure.  Concerns around risks related to AI are also rising.  Main categories of risk, particularly relevant when  leveraging AI solutions for humanitarian good, include  bias and fairness, privacy, security and explainability.  Bias in AI may perpetuate existing social inequalities,  leading to unfair outcomes. Stakeholders will require  transparency of use and will likely want to provide  individuals with clear explanations of decisions or  predictions based on AI-enabled tools.  Tech for Good companies  could reflect on potential  solution spaces in major  humanitarian domains  where AI can unlock step- changing impact  Successful application of AI for humanitarian good  demands an efficient cross- collaboration between  private and public-sector organizations. This will  require tech companies, NGOs, government entities,  and impact experts to work on data availability,  accessibility, and connectivity issues, collaborating  closely on use cases to ensure implementation and  impact at scale.  There has been growing momentum over the last  few years to use AI for the common good. The AI for  Good Global Summit, a ITU/UN-sponsored AI summit  established three years ago, has seen consistent  growth, and the Global Data Commons, co-organized  by The Future Society, UN Global Pulse, AI Commons  and McKinsey’s Noble Intelligence initiative, has seen  over 100 organizations participate.20 Other cross- sector alliances are emerging such as 2030 Vision and  The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence.21   During the Summit, companies could focus on four  critical humanitarian challenges where AI can unlock  step-changing impact: health, hunger, crisis response  (including natural disaster resilience) and security and  justice.   Technological advances can promote equitable  access to healthcare. For example, during the COVID- 19 pandemic, many patients experienced medical  teleconsultation for the first time.   20  AI for Good Global Summit 2020: Accelerating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aiforgood.itu.int; Global Data Commons, Global Pulse,   September 25, 2019, unglobalpulse.org.  21  2030 Vision, 2030vision.com; French Coordinator of France’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. Proposed jointly by France and Canada, The Global  Partnership on AI is an international multi-stakeholder initiative that will be officially created in June 2020. It will include more than a dozen founding states  and will be open to many more. Its aim is to detect, support and perfect responsible uses of AI, with a concern for compatibility at all times with the values of  human autonomy, respect for democratic principles and attention to the challenges of sustainable development (French Coordinator of France’s National  Strategy for Artificial Intelligence).   43  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report © Présidence de la République française  Where connectivity permits, similar solutions could be  developed to support dispensaries and health centers  in poorly covered and underprivileged areas. Rapidly  developing satellite connectivity solutions could be  mobilized to facilitate access to medical services. One  can thus imagine the development of an international  humanitarian medical action that would use advances  in telemedicine to deliver care at lower cost to the  patient, taking advantage of lower operating costs and  reduced travel time.  The increased digitization of humanitarian or local  medical services could also provide databases  for the development of epidemiology and public  health policies based on data more suited to the  humanitarian context.  In order to fight hunger more successfully, the  development of precision agriculture based on local  data (for example, meteorology, early detection of  plant diseases, and targeted treatment) could be used  to preserve soil quality and improve crop productivity.  Similarly, facilitated access to data and real-time  evaluation of opportunities could greatly improve the  functioning of agricultural micro-markets fed by food  surpluses.  To support companies in their reflection, we share  below some successful use cases led by McKinsey’s  Noble Intelligence initiative.22 Please note, this list is  not exhaustive; as mentioned above, many other AI for  good initiatives have been deployed recently.   22  Noble Intelligence is an initiative by McKinsey & Company, engaging non-governmental organizations, respected think tanks, and industry leaders as part of  a global movement to use technology responsibly to benefit society and the environment and drive AI applications for humanitarian causes; for information  see “Noble Intelligence: Harnessing artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to address social and humanitarian crises,” McKinsey.com.  44  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Crisis response: Leveraging  AI and satellite imagery to  improve disaster relief  Natural disasters kill more than 50,000 people and  displace tens of millions more each year.23 McKinsey  Noble Intelligence is working with an international  aid organization to assess damage to schools from a  devastating cyclone in Africa that displaced more than  160,000 people, and damaged 205,000 buildings and  4,000 classrooms. Traditional damage assessments of  buildings and schools can take weeks. An AI-enabled  solution involves comparing satellite and drone image  data before and after the disaster to detect where  displaced people are located and assess schools  damage post-disaster—speeding up aid, optimizing  the distribution of temporary schools and focusing  rebuilding efforts to get more children back to school  faster.24  Satellite imagery linked to AI could also better  anticipate the impact of climate change on people,  buildings and assets, so that corrective and adaptive  measures can be taken as quickly as possible to protect  the population and preserve livelihoods.  Security and justice:  Harnessing the power of  AI to improve recovery  for survivors of human  trafficking  Worldwide, about 40 million people are victims of  human trafficking each year. By applying analytics and  AI algorithms to a database of anonymized survivor  support journeys, McKinsey Noble Intelligence helped  an anti-slavery organization understand how it could  improve the likelihood of recovery for survivors and  scale the number of people it helps. McKinsey experts  used a combination of machine learning, natural  language processing, and journey analytics mapping  to understand the drivers of survivors’ recovery and  find ways to raise the likelihood that they could quickly  regain their lives. As a result, the aid organization  enhanced its survivor aftercare delivery program, one  that will help survivors recover faster and give them  the tools to remain healthy and self-sufficient. The  analysis identified specific areas to improve aftercare  services, such as making a 30-day contact window  standard, using early indicators to flag survivors who  may need additional support, and monitoring survivor  sentiment in case notes.25  Driving AI applications for humanitarian causes and  scaling impact on a global level requires a focus on  applied AI and impact delivery as well as a strong  collaboration between many stakeholders including  tech companies, NGOs, government entities, and  impact experts. The AI for Good workstream will  reflect on concrete actions that could be collectively  undertaken to applying AI capabilities to address  critical humanitarian challenges.  \\u2003  23  “Notes from the AI frontier: Applying AI for social good”, op. cit. 24  ”Noble Intelligence”, op. cit. 25  “Harnessing the power of AI to improve recovery for survivors of human trafficking,” McKinsey.com.  45  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Accountable Tech  As highlighted above, business leaders have a key  role to play in protecting society against tech risks  when they exist. The workstreams are already taking  action. The Tech for Environment workstream for  instance, has launched dedicated initiatives to reduce  the tech carbon footprint. During the next Summit,  our objective is to set further ambitions, and dedicate  sessions to reflect on five major tech risks for society,  as described below, and discuss solution spaces to  address them through examples.   Online harm  As more of our daily lives move online, the risk of  online harm is becoming increasingly prevalent. Risks  here includes addictive behaviors, anxieties such as  fear of missing out (FOMO) which generate further  addiction, cyberbullying and trolling, and the dangers  of illegal content dissemination.  The Christchurch mass shooting attack in New Zealand  last year, that was broadcast live by the gunman, was  a stark reminder of how difficult it can be to prevent  the dissemination of ultra-violent and extremist  political content online. Social media networks  struggled to stop the spread of the 17-minute video  that was uploaded on their platforms, as users shared  the original and subsequently uploaded new copies,  including modified versions to avoid detection.26  Governments came together in a united response  through the Christchurch Call To Action Summit in May  2019. Launched by the French President and the New  Zealand Prime Minister, this mobilized ten heads of  state, government and international organizations, as  well as major players in the digital sector all pledging  commitment to a set of collective actions. Today this is  supported by 48 states, the European Commission and  two international organizations as well as a number of  international civil society organizations.27   26  Alex Hern and Jim Waterson, “Social media firms fight to delete Christchurch shooting footage,” The Guardian, March 15, 2019, theguardian.com. 27  “Christchurch call to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online (May 15, 2019),” Ministère de l’Europe et des Affaires étrangères,    diplomatie.gouv.fr.  46  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Estonia took mitigating actions such as setting up a  Cyber Defence Unit in 2011 and training the country’s  leading IT experts by the Ministry of Defence.31  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members  also reacted. In 2008, NATO’s first cyber defense  policy was prepared and the NATO Cooperative Cyber  Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) was  created.32 The NATO CCD COE launched the Locked  Shields in 2010, an advanced international cyber  defense exercise involving more than 1,000 experts  from nearly 30 nations.33  The Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,  which is a call to come together to face the new risks  endangering citizens and infrastructure, was launched  in November 2018, by the President of French  Republic. It invites all cyberspace actors to work  together and encourages states to cooperate with  private-sector partners, research institutions and civil  society. The Paris Call now includes 78 states, 29 public  authorities and local governments, 349 organizations  and members of civil society and 644 companies and  private-sector entities. Other initiatives launched  within the G7 (Dinard Declaration) and the G20 are  aligned with the core principles of the Paris Call and  continue to promote its spirit.34  Additionally, the New Zealand government announced  the creation of a dedicated team to prosecute terrorist  online content, and Australia, France and Germany  passed legislation setting out penalties for social  media companies that fail to remove identified violent  content and asking them to increase transparency.  Last but not least, the UK’s communications regulator,  the Office of Communications, was given expanded  powers to ensure that social media firms act on  harmful content.28  Social media networks also introduced new measures  aimed at preventing similar occurrences. For instance,  since the launch of the Christchurch Call, members  of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism  (GIFCT) reformed the organization’s governance and  structure to allow for enhanced transparency and  better cooperation between companies, states and  civil society organizations.29  There has been a lot of progress but the debate  regarding the status and role of social media, as well  as the rules to be applied, is not yet settled as many  more complex legal and societal issues are still to be  addressed.  Digital infrastructure  protection  Risks include cyberattacks on businesses, institutions  and IoT devices as well as data hacking and acts of  terrorism.  The first known cyberattack on an entire country  occurred in April 2007, when Estonia was hit by major  cyberattacks targeting parliament, banks, newspapers  and broadcasters, which in some cases lasted for  weeks. Online services of Estonian banks, media  outlets and government bodies were taken down.30  28  Eleanor Ainge Roy, “Christchurch attack: New Zealand tries new tactic to disrupt online extremism”, The Guardian, October 14, 2019, theguardian.com; Paul  Karp, “Australia passes social media law penalising platforms for violent content”, The Guardian, April 4, 2019, theguardian.com; “Regulator Ofcom to have  more powers over UK social media”, BBC News, February 12, 2020, bbc.com; French Ambassador for Digital Affairs.  29  French Ambassador for Digital Affairs. 30  Rain Ottis, “Analysis of the 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia from the information warfare perspective”, Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,   Estonia, ccdcoe.org.  31  CCDCOE, https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/CDU_Analysis.pdf#page=7&zoom=100,93,122. 32  CCDCOE, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, ccdcoe.org/organisations/nato/. 33  “Locked shields”, CCDCOE, ccdcoe.org/exercises/locked-shields/. 34  French Ambassador for Digital Affairs.  47  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Disinformation  Risks include information manipulation and the  practice of micro-targeting audiences with tailored  messaging, for example for political ends.   France is promoting an open and transparent  approach, based on empowering civil society, by  developing open tools to counter information  manipulation. 35  The EU has launched an Action Plan against  disinformation which addresses disinformation as an  evolving risk. One of its pillars is the mobilization of  the private sector through the implementation of a  Code of Practice against Disinformation that aims at  increasing collaboration and transparency regarding  social media. Another pillar is the improvement of  tools for detecting online disinformation campaigns.  The Rapid Alert System (a European network of  contact points) has been created for this context.  France is also part of the Rapid Response mechanism,  a network gathering the G7 States, which aims at  sharing best practices to fight disinformation.36  Civil society has also launched several key initiatives.  For example, Reporters without Borders (RSF)  launched the Journalism Trust Initiative that aims  to create a common standard which defines and  promotes reliable information production. RSF also  launched the Information and Democracy Partnership  to define principles and objectives to promote access  to reliable information. A Stakeholder Forum was  launched during the second Paris Peace Forum in  November 2019 to support the implementation of the  Partnership by drawing up recommendations.37  Some social media companies have already reacted  by strengthening safeguards to ensure online-content  control.   Human bias in AI The growing use of AI in sensitive areas, including  hiring, criminal justice, and healthcare, has stirred  debate about bias. Many experts welcomed  algorithms as an antidote to human bias, but many  others worry that they may in fact scale human  biases. To ensure responsible use of AI, the challenge  will be to improve AI systems to prevent them from  perpetuating human biases or creating bias of their  own. Ultimately, human judgment is crucial to ensure  that AI-supported decision making is fair.38  Many stakeholders, from both public and private  sectors, are acting to ensure the responsible use of  AI. Several academic initiatives have been launched,  including the creation of the AI Now Institute in 2017  at New York University and the Alan Turing Institute’s  Fairness, Transparency, Privacy group.39  The European Commission created the High-Level  Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence in June 2018 to  support the implementation of the European Strategy  on Artificial Intelligence, including Ethics guidelines for  trustworthy AI.40  France and Canada launched the Global Partnership  on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in 2019 during the  G7 Summit. This partnership aims to bring together  global AI experts to foster international collaboration  and coordination on AI policy development among  like-minded partners. Its goal is to foster an alliance of  democratic states respectful of fundamental rights in  the digital domain.41  35  https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/. 36  French Ambassador for Digital Affairs. 37  French Ambassador for Digital Affairs. 38  “Notes from the AI frontier: Tackling bias in AI (and in humans),” McKinsey Global Institute, June 2019, McKinsey.com. 39  AI Now, ainowinstitute.org; “Fairness, transparency, privacy,” The Alan Turing Institute, turing.ac.uk. 40  “High-level expert group on artificial intelligence,” European Commission, ec.europa.eu. 41  French Ambassador for Digital Affairs.  48  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report Leading technology and civil-society groups launched  the Partnership on AI in 2016. The partnership  numbers more than 100 members from academia,  civil society, industry, and nonprofit organizations.42  Tech players are engaging too. For instance, Google AI  published Google’s Responsible AI practices in 2018.43  Microsoft released its AI principles and IBM launched  AI Fairness 360.  Environmental footprint Society is moving online and digital use within  companies is increasing tremendously, leading  to some negative impacts on the environment.  According to the French Agency for ecological  transition (ADEME), as of November 2019, the digital  sector alone was responsible for 4 percent of global  greenhouse gas emissions and the strong increase in   use suggests a doubling of this carbon footprint by  2025. Greenhouse gas emissions in this sector are  primarily due to equipment, which is responsible for  47 percent of the emissions; 28 percent comes from  network infrastructures and 25 percent is due to data  centers.44  To reduce the data carbon footprint, the Tech for  Environment workstream has already launched  dedicated initiatives.  As highlighted, the workstreams are already acting.  During the next Summit, we intend to further engage  them in reflecting on these five tech risks and the  challenges they pose for society. We will discuss  what key actions, such as self-regulation measures,  companies could further take to protect citizens from  potential harm.   © Présidence de la République française  42  Partnership on AI, partnershiponai.org. 43  Google, AI, “Google AI principles updates, six months in,” blog entry by Kent Walker, December 18, 2018, https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/google-ai-  principles-updates-six-months/.  44  “La face cachée du numérique,” op. cit.  49  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report As this report is being published, millions of people  around the world are seeing their lives impacted  by the coronavirus pandemic and its devastating  economic consequences. People are rightly concerned  for themselves and for their loved ones—while many  organizations are facing the most severe crisis they  have ever faced.  No one knows the specific shape of the “next normal”,  or what changes in consumer behaviors and policies  will stick, nor to what extent. However, the past few  months have given us indications for us to venture a  directional view:  Technology is expanding within our lives, our  economies, and our society. From ecommerce to  virtual learning and telehealth, to biotech and the  widespread shift to remote working; technology  has played a crucial role in the crisis—and adoption  of digital solutions has seen a step-change across  verticals. Even if technology itself is neither good  nor bad, it is what we do with it that matters and we  witnessed many truly positive uses of technology for  the common good during the crisis.  Public and private sectors increasingly see their  futures converging. Around the world, governments  have made financial commitments unprecedented  in their scale (mid-April, government stimulus plans  announced worldwide amount to $10.6 trillion), and  the public increasingly expects—indeed, demands— that this money be used for social good, to the benefit  of many. At the same time, corporations around  the world, among which many are Tech for Good  participants, reached far beyond their core business to  support healthcare and social services, communities,  families and students, making their employees proud  and the public thankful. The crisis has brought into  sharper focus a sense of purpose and solidarity for the  public and private sector alike.  Postface by   K. Sneader  and M. Lévy  50  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress report  — We are setting further ambitions bringing new  reflection perspectives on AI for Good with the  objective of leveraging AI capabilities to tackle  critic al humanitarian challenges as well as on  Accountable Tech to further reflect on potential  solution spaces to help mitigate tech risks on  society.   — Across workstreams, companies increased their   collaboration to drive larger impact together while  more startups joined the adventure, which will  increase in the future.  As the crisis continues and recovery seems still  distant to many of us, we believe that some of what  we have witnessed during the crisis will not end. On  the contrary, technology usage will continue to grow,  common action between actors will be more needed  than ever… and Tech for Good companies will continue  their collective efforts to promote positive usage of  technology for the common Good.  There might be a long way to go. But we are on the  road and we believe, in its own way, Tech for Good is a  way to accelerate this collaboration.  Kevin Sneader,   Managing Partner McKinsey & Company  Maurice Lévy,   Chairman Publicis  Companies went from competition to common  purpose. In the past weeks we saw small tech startups  bring their digital solutions to help large corporations  rapidly switch to remote working. We saw large  industrial players support their local suppliers,  adapting their contractual terms to safeguard  businesses and jobs. We saw organizations act in  incredibly humane ways to support their employees,  even while having to let them go to ensure their  survival. And there are hundreds of other examples  of companies joining together in an unprecedented  collaborative spirit with the shared conviction that the  only solution is collective. Large and small, tech and  non-tech, companies have strengthened their links to  defend their ecosystems.  Despite the turbulence that our societies, institutions  and companies have experienced, the 86 participants  in the Tech For Good initiative have displayed a  commendable commitment and undertaken many  efforts that made this report possible. They kept  pushing forward and even expanded on their range of  initiatives, to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. A year  after the 2019 Tech for Good Summit, we are able to  celebrate some significant successes:    — We launched new workstreams on Environment   and Economic inclusiveness, driving impact  on GHG emissions reduction and digital  empowerment of millions of individuals in France,  Europe and across the globe.   — We developed new initiatives and new   commitments to promote tech in Education,  to increase Gender diversity in tech roles and  prepare for the Future of Work by promoting  soft and technological skills within and beyond  companies.  51  TECH FOR GOOD SUMMIT 2020  I  Progress
